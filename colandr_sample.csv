This research focused on the feasibility of removing the introduced predatory peacock grouper Cephalopholis argus, locally known as roi, as a management tool for Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem restoration. The objectives of this study were to investigate the dynamics of C. argus on 1.3 hectares (ha) of coral reef at Puako, Hawai'i, and to (1) compare population density estimate methods in order to accurately evaluate abundance, (2) estimate population mortality and catchability rates, and (3) quantify the recolonization rates by mapping distribution and movements in response to a depletion experiment. The number of individuals removed during a fishdown experiment provided a direct measure of initial population abundance (20.2 roi ha super(-1)). A Leslie depletion model yielded the most accurate assessment of initial density (-15.8{\%} error) compared to belt transects (+75.7{\%} error) and towboard census (-70.2{\%} error). Estimates of total mortality were low (0.12 to 0.14), and fishing mortality ranged from negligible to 8.0{\%} yr super(-1) in west Hawai'i. Roi movement was monitored through a mark and recapture program. Tagged individuals traveled 50 to 150 m from the periphery toward the center of the removal area (1 roi every 1 to 2 mo).

However, effects of habitat loss and fragmentation are typically confounded during disturbance events, and previous attempts to determine their relative significance have proved ineffective. Here we experimentally manipulated live coral habitats to examine the potential independent and interactive effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on survival, abundance, and species richness of recruitment-stage, coral-associated reef fishes. Loss of 75{\%} of live coral from experimental reefs resulted in low survival of a coral-associated damselfish and low abundance and richness of other recruits 16 weeks after habitat manipulations. In contrast, fragmentation had positive effects on damselfish survival and resulted in greater abundance and species richness of other recruits. We hypothesize that spacing of habitat through fragmentation weakens competition within and among species. Comparison of effect sizes over the course of the study period revealed that, in the first six weeks following habitat manipulations, the positive effects of fragmentation were at least four times stronger than the effects of habitat loss. This initial positive effect of fragmentation attenuated considerably after 16 weeks, whereas the negative effects of habitat loss increased in strength over time. There was little indication that the amount of habitat influenced the magnitude of the habitat fragmentation effect. Numerous studies have reported dramatic declines in coral reef fish abundance and diversity in response to disturbances that cause the loss and fragmentation of coral habitats. Our results suggest that these declines occur as a result of habitat loss, not habitat fragmentation. Positive fragmentation effects may actually buffer against the negative effects of habitat loss and contribute to the resistance of reef fish populations to declines in coral cover.",2011,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,92,,10.1890/10-0627.1,0012-9658,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""1503"", ""end_page"": ""1512"", ""primary_date"": ""2011-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Contrasting effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on coral-associated reef fishes"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Consequently, we tested the potential for diversity-effects with a series of surveys and experiments evaluating the influence of browsing herbivores on macroalgae in Kenya's fringing reef ecosystem. We surveyed sites and undertook experiments in reefs subject to three levels of human fishing influence: open access fished reefs, small and recently established community-managed marine reserves, and larger, older government-managed marine reserves. Older marine reserves had a greater overall diversity of herbivores and browsers but this was not clearly associated with reduced macroalgal diversity or abundance. Experiments studying succession on hard substrata also found no effects of consumer diversity. Instead, overall browser abundance of either sea urchins or fishes was correlated with declines in macroalgal cover. An exception was that the absence of a key fish browser genus, Naso, which was correlated with the persistence of Sargassum in a marine reserve. Algal selectivity assays showed that macroalgae were consumed at variable rates, a product of strong species-specific feeding and low overlap in the selectivity of browsing fishes. We conclude that the effects of browser and herbivore diversity are less than the influences of key species, whose impacts emerge in different contexts that are influenced by fisheries management.

However, understanding social data, including people's values and preferences, is critical to both effective planning and management and long-term MPA success. Having these social data in a spatial form is essential, given that MPA planning and management increasingly uses marine spatial planning (MSP) approaches to carefully locate and mediate among potentially competing uses in both space and time. An online Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was used to collect spatially explicit information on stakeholder values and management preferences for Australia's remote Kimberley region. The Kimberley coast and marine environment is characterised by a multiplicity of values and preferences. Key values included biological conservation, aesthetics, recreational fishing, Aboriginal culture and heritage, and nature based tourism. Management preferences were dominated by the desire to increase conservation/protection, exclude oil/gas development and commercial fishing, and to increase Aboriginal management. The diversity of values and preferences present suggests potential for conflict over management and permitted uses. Significant associations between value and preference distribution and the Kimberley's five marine protected areas were analysed. Accessibility and respondent familiarity appear linked to value attribution. More accessible MPAs were significantly associated with recreation values while more remote MPAs were characterised by a conservation ethos and general aversion to development. Our research demonstrates that PPGIS enables documentation of spatially explicit social data across large scales, highlighting potential synergies and conflicts in values and permitted uses, in a manner that can readily integrate with ecologically based marine spatial planning processes.

Over the past decade, high survival coupled with fast growth of in situ nursery corals have allowed practitioners to create healthy and genotypically diverse nursery stocks. Currently, thousands of corals are propagated and outplanted onto degraded reefs on a yearly basis, representing a substantial increase in the abundance, biomass, and overall footprint of A. cervicornis. Here, we combined an extensive dataset collected by restoration practitioners to document early (1-2 yr) restoration success metrics in Florida and Puerto Rico, USA. By reporting region-specific data on the impacts of fragment collection on donor colonies, survivorship and productivity of nursery corals, and survivorship and productivity of outplanted corals during normal conditions, we provide the basis for a stop-light indicator framework for new or existing restoration programs to evaluate their performance. We show that current restoration methods are very effective, that no excess damage is caused to donor colonies, and that once outplanted, corals behave just as wild colonies. We also provide science-based benchmarks that can be used by programs to evaluate successes and challenges of their efforts, and to make modifications where needed. We propose that up to 10% of the biomass can be collected from healthy, large A. cervicornis donor colonies for nursery propagation. We also propose the following benchmarks for the first year of activities for A. cervicornis restoration: (1) >75% live tissue cover on donor colonies; (2) >80% survivorship of nursery corals; and (3) >70% survivorship of outplanted corals. Finally, we report productivity means of 4.4 cm yr(-1) for nursery corals and 4.8 cm yr(-1) for outplants as a frame of reference for ranking performance within programs.

Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Spillover can contribute to poverty alleviation, although its effect is modulated by the number of fishermen and fishing intensity. In this study, we quantify the effects of a community-managed marine reserve in a high poverty area of Northern Mozambique. For this purpose, underwater visual censuses of reef fish were undertaken at three different times: 3 years before (2003), at the time of establishment (2006) and 6 years after the marine reserve establishment (2012). The survey locations were chosen inside, outside and on the border of the marine reserve. Benthic cover composition was quantified at the same sites in 2006 and 2012. After the reserve establishment, fish sizes were also estimated. Regression tree models show that the distance from the border and the time after reserve establishment were the variables with the strongest effect on fish abundance. The extent and direction of the spillover depends on trophic group and fish size. Poisson Generalized Linear Models show that, prior to the reserve establishment, the survey sites did not differ but, after 6 years, the abundance of all fish inside the reserve has increased and caused spillover of herbivorous fish. Spillover was detected 1 km beyond the limit of the reserve for small herbivorous fishes. Six years after the establishment of a community-managed reserve, the fish assemblages have changed dramatically inside the reserve, and spillover is benefitting fish assemblages outside the reserve.",2015,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,10,,10.1371/journal.pone.0111774,1932-6203,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""primary_date"": ""2015-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Spillover Effects of a Community-Managed Marine Reserve"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Broad-scale resource inventories of coastal seagrasses were completed in the 1980s and were used in marine park and fisheries zoning to protect some seagrasses. At least eleven of the fifteen known species in the region reach their latitudinal limits of distribution in Queensland and at least two Halophila species may be endemic to Queensland or northeastern Australia. The importance of seagrasses to Dugongs Dugong dugon, Green Turtles Chelonia mydas and commercially valuable prawn fisheries, will continue to strongly influence directions in seagrass research and conservation management in Queensland. Widespread loss of seagrasses following natural cyclone and flood events in some locations has had serious consequences to regional populations of Dugong. However, the impacts to Queensland fisheries are little studied. Agricultural land use practices may exacerbate the effects of natural catastrophic events, but the long-term impacts of nutrients, pesticides and sediment loads on Queensland seagrasses are also unknown. Most areas studied are nutrient limited and human impacts on seagrasses in Queensland are low to moderate, and could include increases in habitat since modern settlement. Most impacts are in southern, populated localities where shelter and water conditions ideal for productive seagrass habitat are often targets for port development, and are at the downstream end of heavily modified catchments. For Queensland to avoid losses experienced by other states, incremental increases in impacts associated with population and development pressure must be managed. Seagrass areas receive priority consideration in oil spill management within the Great Barrier Reef and coastal ports. Present fisheries legislation for marine plant protection, marine parks and area closures to trawl fishing help protect inshore seagrass prawn nursery and Dugong feeding habitat, but seagrasses in deep water do not yet receive any special zoning protection. Efficacy of the various Local, State and Commonwealth Acts and planning programmes for seagrass conservation is limited by the expanse and remoteness of Queensland's northern coast, but is improving through broad-based education programmes. Institutional support is sought to enable community groups to augment limited research and monitoring programmes with local 'habitat watch' programmes. Research is helping to describe the responses of seagrass to natural and human impacts and to determine acceptable levels of changes in seagrass meadows and water quality conditions that may cause those changes. The management of loss and regeneration of seagrass is benefiting from new information collected on life histories and mechanisms of natural recovery in Queensland species.

Desalination has been seen as the cure for everything that dams and inter-basin water transfers were unable to solve, including droughts, scarcities, social conflicts, environmental impacts, and political rivalries among the different Spanish regions. Desalination also means a new and powerful element in water planning and management that could provide water for the continuous expansion of the urban and tourist growth machine in Mediterranean Spain and thus relax possible water constraints on this growth. However, by 2012 most new desalination plants along the Mediterranean coast remained almost idle. Focusing on the case of the Mancomunidad de los Canales del Taibillla in South-eastern Spain, our aim is to develop a critical, integrated and reflexive perspective on the use of desalination as a source of water for urban and regional growth.

The population growth (especially in coastal areas) followed by declining natural resources caused by overfishing and overexploitation is one of the biggest concerns both for the central and the local governments in Indonesia. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is one of the attempted solutions to overcome these difficulties, however, it is known to be unsatisfactory even after several programs under ICZM have been developed and implemented. Therefore, further facilitation of ICZM programs is necessary in order to benefit to Indonesian governmental management of their islands, coastal areas and oceans. In doing so, ICZM will also make a significant contribution towards the implementation of the Indonesia Global Ocean Observing System (INA-GOOS). This paper aims to review ICZM activities in Indonesia to obtain a better understanding of, and the need for ICZM implementations in support of their policy, sustainability and decision-making process in the direction of INA-GOOS.

By virtue of their competitive dominance, large size, and longevity, M. californianus are ecosystem engineers that form structurally complex beds that provide habitat for diverse invertebrate communities. We investigated whether otters affect mussel bed characteristics (i.e. mussel length distributions, mussel bed depth, and biomass) and associated community structure (i.e. biomass, alpha and beta diversity) by comparing four regions that varied in their histories of sea otter occupancy on the west coast of British Columbia and northern Washington. Mussel bed depth and average mussel lengths were 1.5 times lower in regions occupied by otters for {\textgreater}20 years than those occupied for {\textless}5 yrs. Diversity of mussel bed associated communities did not differ between regions; however, the total biomass of species associated with mussel beds was more than three-times higher where sea otters were absent. We examined alternative explanations for differences in mussel bed community structure, including among-region variation in oceanographic conditions and abundance of the predatory sea star Pisaster ochraceus. We cannot discount multiple drivers shaping mussel beds, but our findings indicate the sea otters are an important one. We conclude that, similar to their effects on subtidal benthic invertebrates, sea otters reduce the size distributions of intertidal mussels and, thereby, habitat available to support associated communities. Our study indicates that by reducing populations of habitat-providing intertidal mussels, sea otters may have substantial indirect effects on associated communities.",2013,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,8,,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""1"", ""end_page"": ""9"", ""primary_date"": ""2013-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Sea Otters Homogenize Mussel Beds and Reduce Habitat Provisioning in a Rocky Intertidal Ecosystem"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

In 2015 the explosion continues to impact those 11 individual's families; it continues to have a far-reaching emotional impact on the 115 men and women on board at the time of the catastrophe; scientists are still evaluating the environmental impacts of both the oil dispersion throughout the gulf and the oil dispersant used to curtail the spill at surface depths. Simultaneously, gulf business owners, particularly those who rely on gulf waters for their livelihoods, continue to struggle. This novel and far-reaching real-world disaster is particularly salient for use within engineering curricula due to its inherently complex interplay of ethical issues and the broad scope of stakeholders impacted by the initial disaster and its aftermath. We have developed and refined this real-world case study with students participating in a graduate level course at Purdue University over three separate years and five course offerings. We designed this case study within a unique pedagogical framework that leads students to reflectively adopt varying stakeholders' perspectives in order to reason through the case within a team setting. As a final goal, students must decide the appropriateness of continuing deepwater drilling throughout the Gulf of Mexico in light of the human, economic, environmental, and social implications of future potential blowouts. As part of the broader ethics course in which this case is embedded, we selected this case as it provides a uniquely broader scope of stakeholders and a more specific focus on the principles of nonmaleficence and justice when compared to the other cases presented to students. Whereas many engineering ethics case studies focus on human stakeholders and corporations, here the focus also includes marine and aquatic life, challenging a narrowly anthropocentric focus by placing environmental issues as a focal point. In this sense, our focus pushes beyond other case studies in ethics by addressing both macro-ethical issues, where students are encouraged to adopt a broadened societal viewpoint to deduce the most ethical courses of action, and micro-ethical issues, where the focus is towards the professional obligations of an individual engineer, through a scaffolded staged pedagogy. In this paper we present the case structure and pedagogy to argue for the relevance of this unique, novel, and effective case for increasing engineering students' ethical reasoning abilities, particularly broadening their awareness of the scope of stakeholders impacted by engineering decisions and their ability to empathize with those stakeholders. {\textcopyright} American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",,,{NA},{NA},Conference Proceedings,2016-June,,NA,NA,American Society for Engineering Education,NA,"{""url"": ""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983249385%7B%5C&%7DpartnerID=40%7B%5C&%7Dmd5=8f51eba15c11b664408fbc056d94186b"", ""primary_title"": ""Deepwater horizon oil spill: An ethics case study in environmental engineering"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

The extended drought of 1999-2002 worsened the situation and resulted in historic lows for bushels harvested, the number of harvesters, and the oyster population. During the four-year drought, the oyster diseases dermo and MSX spread geographically and increased in prevalences and intensities. Mortality rose to record levels, causing widespread reductions in stocks and a collapse of the fishery. Due to the drought, mortality increased from 19% to 58%, the number of harvesters declined from 2,520 to about 200 and the harvest bottomed out at 26,495 bushels compared to over 1 million bushels prior to 1987. The years 2003 and 2004 brought significant rainfall, which reduced oyster disease effects and increased survival in many areas. However, stock abundance is not rebounding in many areas due to previous years of low recruitment and the accumulated impacts of the diseases on the stocks. When rainfall returns to more normal conditions, mortality will increase again as indicated by past data and oyster losses will increase. Oyster restoration efforts, impacted by the same disease dynamics, are showing no widespread lasting results. Enhancement of specific sites can yield limited positive results in some cases, but site specific enhancements do not equate to population restoration. The goal of restoration is to achieve a self-sustaining and abundant oyster population.

This fishery and that of Kootenay Lake in British Columbia may have been the most robust Burbot fisheries in North America. However, the fishery in Idaho rapidly declined after the construction of Libby Dam by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1972, and it closed in 1992. Concomitant to the collapse in Idaho was the collapse of the Burbot fishery in Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River. The operation of Libby Dam for hydroelectric power generation and flood control created major changes in the river's nutrient concentration, temperature, and seasonal discharge, particularly during the winter when Burbot spawn. Libby Dam operations were implicated as the major limiting factor to Burbot recruitment, giving rise to higher winter temperatures and widely fluctuating flows. Because the Burbot in the Kootenai River are at risk of demographic extinction, a conservation strategy was prepared to outline the measures necessary to rehabilitate the Burbot population to a self-sustaining level. The strategy indicated that operational discharge changes at Libby Dam are required during winter to provide suitable temperature and discharge conditions for Burbot migration and spawning. Studies recommend that the discharge at Bonners Ferry average 176m(3)/s for a minimum of 90 d (mid-November through mid-February). Furthermore, preferred Burbot water temperatures of about 6 degrees C are necessary for migration and cooler temperatures of 1-4 degrees C for spawning. With each passing year, Burbot stock limitations increasingly constrain rehabilitation. Thus, coordination of intensive culture, extensive rearing, and pen rearing among the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, the University of Idaho's Aquatic Research Institute, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game is important for restoration.",2013,,"{""Hardy, Ryan"",""Paragamian, Vaughn L""}",,journal,142,6,10.1080/00028487.2013.790845,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""1662"", ""end_page"": ""1670"", ""primary_date"": ""2013-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""A Synthesis of Kootenai River Burbot Stock History and Future Management Goals"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Hardy, Ryan', 'Paragamian, Vaughn L')""}"

We present the first summary of information gleaned from international tag returns of adult female hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) marked with Marine Turtle Tagging Centre tags. Twenty-one sea turtle projects in 19 countries and overseas territories received Inconel 1005-681 tags from the Marine Turtle Tagging Centre between January 2002 and June 2009, and 12 of these projects have reported tagging adult female hawksbills, for a combined total of 2261 tagged individuals. Sixty-three of these individuals (2.8{\%}), sighted at least once in another country since being tagged, have been reported to the Marine Turtle Tagging Centre; the majority of them (96.8{\%}) were originally tagged while they were nesting in Barbados. Based on minimum straight-line distance traveled, the point of capture averaged 343.9 +/- 69.7 km standard error (SE), (median 175 km) from the nesting beach. The average number of days between tagging and the first recapture was 835 +/- 67.9 days SE, median 860 days). Although the majority of returns came from within a few hundred kilometers of the tagging site, tagged animals often passed through multiple exclusive economic zones and were exposed to conflicting management regimes, which include legal and illegal sea turtle fisheries.

However, odour from these facilities continues to be one of the most important concerns in terms of cost {\&} effective mitigation. This paper provides a technological and life cycle assessment of some of the different odour control technologies and treatment methods that can be implemented in organics processing facilities. The technological assessment compared biofilters, packed tower wet scrubbers, fine mist wet scrubbers, activated carbon adsorption, thermal oxidization, oxidization chemicals and masking agents. The technologies/treatment methods were evaluated and compared based on a variety of operational, usage and cost parameters. Based on the technological assessment it was found that, biofilters and packed bed wet scrubbers are the most applicable odour control technologies for use in organics processing faculties. A life cycle assessment was then done to compare the environmental impacts of the packed-bed wet scrubber system, organic (wood-chip media) bio-filter and inorganic (synthetic media) bio-filter systems. Twelve impact categories were assessed; cumulative energy demand (CED), climate change, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, metal depletion, fossil depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, terrestrial eco-toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity and marine eco-toxicity. The results showed that for all impact categories the synthetic media biofilter had the highest environmental impact, followed by the wood chip media bio-filter system.

Using Delta is no longer an unproven concept, but rather an accepted survey tool as demonstrated in more than 85 peer- reviewed publications since 1988. Maps of sealoor substrata and bathymetric data are commonly used to identify and quantify survey sites, which serves both to increase the cost- effectiveness of the submersible and provide the frame within which to distribute sampling effort. In turn, direct observations from Delta can be used to validate the interpretation of such habitat maps. Values that are commonly measured or estimated during Delta dives include the number and length of organisms, distance to a ish, and distance along a transect, from which habitat-specific species density, total abundance, and biomass can be calculated.

But natural wealth of a territorial sea has often been the source of disputes among the nations bordering it.When all coastal states extend their jurisdiction, no area will be left unclaimed and some claims may indeed be overlap. Neither PRC nor the others is likely to compromise its position toward each other in sea disputes. One of the main reaction for their intransigency is the fact that each of them is locked in self and economic zone boundary problems in sea dispute.Since the adaption of the Continental Shelf Convention of April 29, 1958, boundary delimitation has created as serious problems.

The first type concerns the disputed ownership of island territories. The second type is the delimitation of overlapping maritime claims.

We present a fully-crossed factorial mesocosm study and assess how warming and acidification affect the abundance, body size, and fatty acid composition of copepods as a measure of nutritional quality. The experimental set-up allowed us to determine whether the effects of warming and acidification act additively, synergistically, or antagonistically on the abundance, body size, and fatty acid content of copepods, a major group of lower level consumers in marine food webs. Copepodite (developmental stages 1-5) and nauplii abundance were antagonistically affected by warming and acidification. Higher temperature decreased copepodite and nauplii abundance, while acidification partially compensated for the temperature effect. The abundance of adult copepods was negatively affected by warming. The prosome length of copepods was significantly reduced by warming, and the interaction of warming and CO2 antagonistically affected prosome length. Fatty acid composition was also significantly affected by warming. The content of saturated fatty acids increased, and the ratios of the polyunsaturated essential fatty acids docosahexaenoic-(DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) to total fatty acid content increased with higher temperatures. Additionally, here was a significant additive interaction effect of both parameters on arachidonic acid. Our results indicate that in a future ocean scenario, acidification might partially counteract some observed effects of increased temperature on zooplankton, while adding to others. These may be results of a fertilizing effect on phytoplankton as a copepod food source. In summary, copepod populations will be more strongly affected by warming rather than by acidifying oceans, but ocean acidification effects can modify some temperature impacts. {\textcopyright} 2016 Garzke et al.

A coherent, sharp increase in SSBs from 1975 to 1985 and a subsequent decrease from 1985 to 1992 are superimposed on the general decline. The coherence suggests that cod stock variability in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean is driven by a common set of causes or that the linkages among the nominal stocks are stronger than was previously thought. The coherent increases in cod SSB from the mid-1970s to 1985 occurred under relatively low fishing mortalities. The declines in SSB beginning in 1985 began during a period of low fishing mortalities. During the 1985-1992 period the declines in Atlantic cod abundance were coupled with greatly reduced growth rates, increased natural mortality rates, and a lack of response to reduced fishing mortality. This suggests that the 1985-1992 decreases were driven by a strong negative environmental signal, implying that the environment had a stronger role in affecting cod abundance than had been previously thought. It appears that the decline in SSB Over Most of the range of the cod was coupled with a major perturbation in the forage available to cod.

Here we report an overview of people's perceptions and views regarding marine environmental issues, where the opinions of the general population and a group of marine experts were analysed and compared. Results based on 735 face-to-face interviews conducted in the Azores archipelago (north-eastern mid-Atlantic) showed significant differences among experts and public opinion regarding drivers of change, marine pressures and management priorities. The survey also showed that the public was poorly informed about marine protected areas (MPAs) and eco-labelling schemes (ELSs). Taken together these results build upon the widely held perception that there is a gap between what is known among the scientific community and what the public know and understand about the marine environment, and emphasise the importance of involving the public, scientists and other stakeholders in all stages of the marine management process.

We developed a new telemetry approach for estimating natural and fishing mortality rates and applied it to the population of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Gaston, North Carolina and Virginia. Our analyses were based on a sample size of 51 telemetered striped bass that were known to be alive and in Lake Gaston at least 1 month after capture and surgery. Relocations of live fish and fish that died of natural causes were used to estimate natural and fishing mortality rates and the probability of relocating telemetered fish. Fishing mortality rates varied seasonally, but few natural deaths were observed, so the best model incorporated a constant annual instantaneous natural mortality rate (M; +/- SE) of 0.14 +/- 0.02. With the uncertainty in model selection accounted for, the average annual M was 0.16 +/- 0.04 For 1997 and 0.12 +/- 0.04 for 1998. Estimated annual fishing mortality rates (F) were 0.74 +/- 0.13 for 1997 and 0.34 +/- 0.18 for 1998. This telemetry approach for estimating mortality rates does not rely on angler reporting of tagged fish.

Algal farms in one lagoon hosted a more abundant and diversified fish fauna than controls, whereas farms in the other lagoon exhibited lower fish densities and similar species diversity compared to controls.

Rapid assays of reproductive potential are central to this monitoring, and there is a need to develop a variety of methods to identify responses. Here, we report a proof of-concept study that assesses whether quantification of ""Sperm Accumulated Against Surface"" (SAAS) of tissue culture well-plates could be a rapid and simple proxy measure of fertilisation success. Our results confirm that motile sperm (but not immotile sperm) actively accumulate at surfaces and that the pattern of accumulation reflects fertilisation success in the model oyster species Crassostrea gigas. Furthermore, we confirm these patterns of SAAS for another marine species, the polychaete Galeolaria caespitosa, as well as for a freshwater species, the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus. For all species considered, SAAS reflected changes in sperm performance caused by experimentally manipulated differences in water quality (here, salinity). These findings indicate that SAAS could be applied easily to a range of species when examining the effects of water quality. Measurement of SAAS could, therefore, form the basis of a rapid and reliable assay for bioassessments of broadcast spawning aquatic organisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The loch system, comprising the main loch together with its two arms, Loch Dughaill and Loch a' Chad-Fi, was established as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) in 2005, being judged to be one of the best examples in the UK of a 'large shallow inlet and bay' and for the possession of extensive reef habitats. The purpose of the current study was to initiate site condition monitoring of the littoral and sublittoral reefs and inlet and bay features within the SAC. This was done to establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The main approach taken to achieve these objectives was to perform a video survey of the sublittoral reef and sediment biotopes (different habitats with their recurring characteristic species communities) at 135 sites, together with infaunal grab sampling of sediments at 30 sites, and to survey the shore and nearshore reef and sediment biotopes along relocatable transects at eleven sites. Surveys were also performed along transects at three maerl sites and the distribution of the unattached form of the knotted wrack, Ascophyllum nodosum ecad mackayi, and beds of the mussel, Mytilus edulis, were examined at the head of Loch Laxford. The main findings were: o The video survey found sedimentary habitats to dominate the sublittoral area of the SAC, with reef habitats largely confined to a narrow coastal fringe, apart from a tongue of bedrock and boulder reefs extending from the tip of the Ardmore peninsular. Of the 135 sites examined, 41 (30%) contained reef habitats. o The SAC was found to contain a high diversity of biotopes, with 88 being recorded, of which 53 were reef biotopes. o Grazed Laminaria hyperborea biotopes dominated infralittoral rock in the outer part of the SAC, with forests extending to at least 8 m and parks to at least 17 m. Circalittoral bedrock and boulder substrates were recorded down to 49 m, generally supporting species-poor faunal and algal crust communities. In more sheltered areas of the SAC kelp forests became dominated by Saccharina latissima or cape-form L. hyperborea, below which circalittoral rock supported ascidian dominated communities. o Ascophyllum nodosum ecad mackayi was recorded at six sites at the head of Loch Laxford and discrete beds mapped at three of these sites. Mytilus edulis beds were recorded at three sites at the head of the loch, with mapping undertaken at the two major sites. o Little evidence of significant adverse anthropogenic impact on the interest features of the SAC was revealed. The presence of a mussel farm at one of the maerl sites was causing localised modification of the habitat through the deposition of dead shells. This is likely to be modifying the community composition and may be influencing the distribution of the biotope. The introduced Pacific red alga, Heterosiphonia japonica, was recorded predominantly in the vicinity of a salmon farm site, with the related shipping activity being a possible vector.

We developed an experimental treatment to measure the effects of a pedestrian walking on a site used by overwintering waterbirds in a wetland of international importance. We registered 156 events (88 at high tide) of flushing birds, totaling 4,018 individuals. Each treatment drove the flushing of 1-5 % of the wintering populations of nearly all species present during high tide. In addition, 1.5 % of the Eurasian curlew wintering population was driven to change site. All the effects were found to be reduced during other tidal periods. Therefore, allowing recreational use in a previously undisturbed area can systematically increase daily energy expenditure of significant percentages of different waterbird populations during high tide, and even cause birds to avoid a site completely. These effects will probably be even worse given that our results were derived only from a disturbance source of low magnitude and frequency.

VPA was carried out tuning the estimated fishing mortality rate at age by fitting on corresponding Catch Per Unit of fishing Effort (CPUE). Both VPA and the DeLury model yielded sensible results. The effect on the assessments due to the use of a different birth date and thus of split-year data was investigated. Biomass values as well as patterns over time so estimated were similar on the basis of both assessment methods and calendar year versus split-year data. In particular, the biomass in more recent years (around 100,000 tonnes) was lower than in the second half of the 1970s and first half of the 1980s (over 200,000 tonnes). The minimum value (lower than 50,000 tonnes) was always estimated in 1987, when a strong drop in the catch and crisis of the anchovy fishery took place.

Based on the results of feeding studies with captive animals, it has been suggested that juvenile SSL may reach a digestive capacity that limits their ability to consume enough calories when on a low energy diet, resulting in serious implications for SSLs that primarily eat pollock in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. In the present study, wild juvenile SSL (n = 7) were temporarily held in a captive setting and fed a 100% pollock diet, in both fall (n = 3) and spring (n = 4) for a range of 29-49 days. All animals experienced rapid growth, ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 kg per day, or approximately 25% of their body mass over the duration of the feeding trial. In addition, body fat increased significantly (9.0 +/- 3.2%) between capture and the end of the feeding trials. Daily intake of pollock ranged from 7.6 to 10.9% of the SSL's body mass. Proximate composition of the pollock revealed variability among lots, however this had no impact on sea lion growth rates. Our results suggest that the dietary implications of pollock as a primary prey item for juvenile SSL need to be revisited, as an understanding of the feeding ecology of this species is crucial for management and recovery of this species, which is listed under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA).

However, to reconstruct the patterns of fish movement and migration using otolith chemistry it is essential to establish the link between changing environmental variables, in particular, temperature, salinity and elemental concentration, and the concentration of elements within otoliths. Using a controlled laboratory experiment we investigated how otolith chemical composition of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca was affected by temperature, salinity and ambient elemental concentration in juvenile sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax. A total of 18 treatments representing all combinations of temperature (21, 25 degrees C), salinity (10, 20, 30) and ambient water concentrations (Low, Medium, High) were assessed. Otolith elemental composition of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca were positively related to ambient water concentration. Consistent interactions between salinity and concentration were found for otolith composition, as well as elemental incorporation, for both elements. Positive effects of temperature on elemental composition and incorporation were also detected. The partition coefficient of Ba (D-Ba) initially decreased with increased water concentration but increased at the highest level of added elemental concentration. Across salinity gradients, D-Ba increased whilst distinct patterns in variation of D-Sr, occurred within water concentration treatments.

The Korean Peninsula covers 222,403 km(2) and contains a mountainous interior, many islands, and biodiversity-rich coastal and marine areas. Biodiversity on the peninsula is not well documented, especially in North Korea, but the peninsula is estimated to host at least 100,000 species, and perhaps manyfold more. Roughly 6% of species identified to date are endemic, and among vertebrate species in South Korea, 29% of mammals, 14% of birds, 23% of freshwater fishes, 48% of reptiles, and 60% of amphibians are estimated to be at risk of extinction or have been extirpated from the peninsula. The situation is likely worse in North Korea. Species still occurring on the Korean Peninsula have survived near total deforestation of the landscape, heavy fishing, pollution, and, in South Korea, a period of rapid urbanization since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Conservation challenges are particularly dire in North Korea, where environmental degradation has impaired the country's ability to sustain agriculture, clean air and water, and other fundamental ecosystem services. Conservation faces significant challenges in South Korea, too, given the country's goal to continue to develop one of the world's most advanced and urbanized economies. Natural resource managers in both North and South Korea are pursuing large-scale restoration of forests, wetlands, lakes and rivers, and coastlines as a primary conservation strategy. In addition, South Korea is aggressively developing a ""green economy"" and is hosting international environmental meetings, attempting to take a leadership role as a convener of innovative thinking in conservation. North and South Korea are also implementing more common land protection techniques, such as the creation of national parks and other protected areas. These protected areas include the exceptional case of the 100,000-ha (250 km x 4 km) Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that forms the border between North and South Korea. The DMZ was not created for conservation reasons, but has provided an important refuge for many species. Other well-known protected areas include Jeju Island and Baekdu Daegan Mountain, both of which host many species important for conservation. Together, these conservation actions show promise and may allow the Korean Peninsula to preserve its biodiversity and regain some of its important ecosystem services. South Korea, in particular, provides an example for attempting to balance economic development and conservation in an area with a long history of human exploitation. North Korea is much farther behind in its conservation efforts, but is now beginning planning for large-scale restoration projects, which if implemented may help reverse its long trend of environmental degradation.

These ideas originate from western industrialized fisheries, but are universally transposed to small scale fisheries under the assumptions that both non-selective fishing and open-access will lead to overfishing or economic loss. Inland fisheries in Africa are traditionally viewed as prime examples of this unregulated path to resource destruction. However, recent research shows that fishing effort in small-scale fisheries, with limited technological development and highly diverse fishing patterns is largely regulated by fluctuating natural production from highly resilient fish communities. By using a wide range of highly adaptive fishing methods, each of which selects specific sections of a fish community an overall unselective fishing pattern may arise which harvest all components according to their relative abundance. Such unregulated, non-selective, adaptive fishing patterns appear far more ecosystem conserving than current single species management approaches. In addition, small-scale fisheries in Africa constitute a 'social security system'. They often serve as the 'last resort' when everything else fails, and for this they have been seriously undervalued. Restricting access would undermine their role in providing this welfare function, particularly for the poorest and least advantaged. The immense pressure from outside to adapt to modem management thinking based on gear restrictions, size limits, and economic theory will, under present conditions, not only have negative social effects, but also biological.

Case study Santa Catarina, Brazil",,"The coastal region of the State of Santa Catarina in Brazil which includes the coastal promontories of Penha, Balneário Camboriú and Itajaí, is among the areas most affected by urbanization in that area, and consequently suffers pressure on natural resources causing destruction or degradation. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the main vectors of pressure on coastal promontories of Penha (São Roque and Monge), Itajaí (Farol de Cabeçudas) and Balneario Camboriú (Taquaras and Taquarinhas). This analysis was based on social and environmental indicators, which tend to facilitate the communicability of complex phenomena and to give subsidy to public managers and civilians, since that simplify complex concepts. For this analysis it was performed a fieldwork in the studies areas, bibliographic and documentary research applicant to the impacts and activities in these areas, as well as research based on data relating to tourism, water quality and demographic development of the municipalities. To evaluate the quality of bathing of beaches in the vicinity of areas of study, it was used the data of the monitoring carried out periodically by the environmental agency of the State of Santa Catarina The diagnosis about the demographic characteristics was developed through research of the evolution of population density of municipalities based on the 1991, 2000 and 2010 census, and population counts in 1996 and. For projections of the evolution of population, for the year 2050 in the municipalities under study, it was used the methodology used by the institute IBGE (governmental institute of statistics). The data on tourism were provided by SANTUR (government institute of tourism), with data for the years 2005-2009 of the amount of tourists on these areas. The analysis was also correlated with the number of beds of occasional use and vacant, to estimate the number of second homes or the number of tourist beds. After the compilation of data and indicators, it was constructed an index of Level of Pressure (LP) composed of three indicators: demographic density, Population Growth and Tourism. The higher the density, population growth and the expressiveness of tourism, the higher the level of pressure, thus establishing a relationship of proportionality between of the Level of Pressure, with the following classes: very high, high, medium, low, very low. This level was combined with the water bathing index (classified as proper or improper) and the Access Level to areas with the purpose of verify which areas with the greatest threats. The access level was classified in three levels: low, medium and high. The higher the rating, the better the local road infrastructure and consequent ease to access it. It was found that the major sources of pressure are population growth and tourism, which end up generating a series of effects to the natural environment. It is possible to observe that the promontories, in generally, has their flora preserved. The bathing water quality is proper for the municipality of Penha, however, in Itajaí there are deteriorating trends, as well as in the outfall of the lagoon of Taquaras in Balneario Camboriu with improper quality, due to sewage releases. Upon analysis of the data, it was found that the combination of the pressure levels with water quality and level of access to the promontories pointed that the promontory of Balneário Camboriu have the greatest threats, with a level of pressure (LP) very high; besides the improper water quality, and access level (AL) high, causing great pressure on the natural resources do promontory. In conclusion, it has been verified the need to expand environmental studies and carry out actions for environmental protection and regulation of land use in these areas of high environmental interest. As regards the use of indicators, these allow to establish relationships and understanding of compact and simplified way of how complex and synergistic phenomena, such as tourism and population growth, interfere with the environmental integrity manifested in t ese areas and/or municipalities.

Previous studies have suggested that the reason for the fragmented distribution pattern of E. depressa is competitive displacement by the sympatric C. stellatus, following random settlement. This hypothesis is in agreement with the common model of zonation suggested by Connell that lower distribution limits are determined by biotic factors (competition and predation), while upper limits are set by physical factors. It is hard to test the validity of this model for this barnacle pair since the early ontogenetic stages of the species are morphologically indistinguishable, hindering our ability to understand distribution processes. Using 16S mtDNA as a genetic marker in a multiplex PCR system, cyprids and spats were individually identified. Settlement and recruitment rates were assessed using settlement plates, and the effect of post-settlement processes was tested with transplantation of settlers between zones. Results showed different strategies in each species: settlement of E. depressa was habitat-specific, while settlement of C. stellatus was random. Shifting individuals of C stellatus to the high and cryptic zones resulted in high mortality; however, exposing juveniles of E. depressa that settled in artificially cryptic low shore habitat to C stellatus presence had no effect on their survival. These finding do not agree with the formerly suggested hypothesis that zonation is mainly determined by post-settlement factors, and that the interspecies boundary is determined by interspecific competition, implying that competition model cannot be adapted to Mediterranean intertidal zonation and that other models, dominated by physical enforcement and pre-settlement recruitment-limiting factors, may prevail in this ecosystem.

Multi-scale investigatory approaches are increasingly encouraged, as the patchy distribution of suitable habitats in fragmented landscapes often determines species presence and survival. Habitat models applied to a threatened New Zealand forest passerine, the South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus carunculatus), reintroduced to Ulva Island (Stewart Island) found that at landscape scale breeding pairs' preferences for sites near the coast were driven by micro-scale vegetation structure. We tested these results by examining models of breeding site selection by a reintroduced saddleback population on Motuara Island (Marlborough Sounds) at two scales: (1) micro-scale, for habitat characteristics that may drive breeding site selection, and (2) landscape scale, for variations in micro-scale habitat characteristics that may influence site colonisation in breeding pairs. Results indicated that birds on Motuara Island responded similarly to those on Ulva Island, i.e. birds primarily settled at the margins of coastal scrub and forest and later cohorts moved into larger stands of coastal forest where they established breeding territories. Plant species composition was also important in providing breeding saddleback pairs with adequate food supply and nesting support. However, Motuara Island birds differed in their partitioning of habitat use: preferred habitats were used for nesting while birds were foraging outside territorial boundaries or in shared sites. These differences may be explained because Motuara has a more homogeneous distribution of microscale habitats throughout the landscape and a highly bird-populated environment. These results show that resource distribution and abundance across the landscape needs to be accounted for in the modelling of density-bird-habitat relationships. In the search for future release sites, food (invertebrates and fruiting tree species) should be abundant close to available nesting sites, or evenly spread and available throughout the landscape.",2008,,"{""Barratt, Barbara I P"",""Dickinson, Katharine J M"",""Jamieson, Ian G"",""Michel, Pascale""}",,journal,32,1,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""18"", ""end_page"": ""33"", ""primary_date"": ""2008-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Multi-scale habitat models for reintroduced bird populations: a case study of South Island saddlebacks on Motuara Island"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Barratt, Barbara I P', 'Dickinson, Katharine J M', 'Jamieson, Ian G', 'Michel, Pascale')""}"

Possible MBAS concentration phenomena could be induced by different evaporation rates among sampling stations and between winter and summer seasons and were evaluated, in this study, using water salinity as possible factor affecting samples segregations. Results evidence that differences of MBAS levels related to evaporation rates are trascurabile if compared to the variability induced by the presence of not-collected wastewater hot-spot pollution sources located closed around the urban settlement and along sandbars.

Fishing is a traditional activity in Portugal and is mainly composed of a great number of small vessels. Given the lack of knowledge on effects of the Portuguese fishing fleet on seabird populations, bycatch was assessed in mainland coastal waters for 2010-2012. Interviews and on-board data were divided into 5 strata, according to fishing gear: Bottom trawling, Bottom longline, Purse seine, Beach seine, Polyvalent (>12 m) and Polyvalent (<12 m). Polyvalent included Setnets, Traps and Demersal longlines. Overall, 68 birds were recorded to be bycaught. The average catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 0.05 birds per fishing event. Polyvalent (<12 m), Polyvalent (>= 12 m) and Purse seiners had the biggest seabird bycatch rates, with 0.5 (CPUE = 0.1), 0.11 (CPUE = 0.05) and 0.2 (CPUE = 0.11) birds per trip, respectively. Within Polyvalent gear, Setnets captured the largest diversity of seabird species (CPUE = 0.06), while Demersal longline had the highest CPUE (0.86). Northern gannet was the most common bycaught species. Although more observation effort is required, our results suggest that substantial numbers of Balearic shearwater might be bycaught annually, mainly in Purse seine and Setnets. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The major ecological impacts were mortality of marine flora and fauna, destruction of aquaculture facilities (cages and ponds), disruption of aquaculture protocol, and frequent occurrence of fish diseases. As a result, fishfarmers suffered substantial financial losses that forced them to either borrow more money (most are already heavily indebted), or stop operation until financial support is available.

To investigate this question, we surgically implanted miniature temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters into 19 adult carpet pythons Morelia spilota (body length 1.3-2.8 m; 1.4-7.0 kg) from two study sites near Bangalow and Mullumbimby, NSW. We located the snakes every few days for the next 32-567 days (mean = 308 days), to obtain data on their movements, habitat use, postures, thermal biology, and food habits. Radio-tracked snakes were primarily arboreal (45% of locations), and generality was more common in males than females, and more common in winter than in other seasons. The snakes generally avoided open areas, but frequently used artificial shelter (e.g. roof spaces in buildings; thickets of non-native tree species). Distances moved were generally small (mean <15 m/day; mean home range = 22.5 ha), and larger in males than in females. Population densities were high, especially in small forested areas that penetrated orchards (>6 snakes/ha; >20 kg/ha). The success of carpet pythons in these areas reflects their inconspicuousness (due to their selection of densely vegetated arboreal habitats, their sedentary nature, and their cryptic coloration), and their preparedness to utilise 'artificial habitats (such as roof spaces) and non-native prey species (mainly, commensal mammals). Prolonged immobility is possible because of the snakes' reliance on ambush predation, and their large body size facilitates thermoregulation without overt shuttling behavior. pythons are vulnerable to predators (especially canids) when they move across large open areas, but generally avoid such habitats. Morelia spilota have declined in regions of Australia where agricultural practices have left no thickly vegetated habitats. Patches of such habitat (even if small, and composed of introduced plant species) appear to be vital for the continued presence of large pythons in the agricultural landscape.

To maintain viable harvests, oyster growers proposed the application of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid onto harvested beds for the control of burrowing shrimp. In test applications, water column concentrations of imidacloprid were relatively low and dissipated rapidly. The foraging activities of the green sturgeon (listed in the US Endangered Species Act) could result in exposure to higher, more sustained imidacloprid concentrations within sediment porewater and from the consumption of contaminated shrimp. Controlled experiments were conducted using surrogate white sturgeon to determine acute and chronic effect concentrations, to examine overt effects at more environmentally realistic concentrations and durations of exposure, and to assess chemical depuration. The 96-h median lethal concentration was 124mgL(-1), and the predicted 35-d no-observed-adverse-effect concentration was 0.7mgL(-1). No overt effects were observed following environmentally relevant exposures. Imidacloprid half-life in plasma was greater than 32h. Measured concentrations of imidacloprid in porewater were significantly lower than the derived acute and chronic effect concentrations for white sturgeon. Exposure risk quotients were calculated using the effect concentrations and estimated environmental exposure.

In Chapter 4, a summary of the study was provided, and the usefulness of policy network in conflict study was understood. The following result has been drawn.First, in the beginning stage of the conflict, the standard for marine boundary resolving the question of the title to public surface of the water was not clear enough, and the provisions of the related law was not properly established. This ultimately precipitated the conflict by leading the local governments to claim that the marine boundary and related law must be remained as it is or changed to their own advantage.Second, in the amplification stage, the local governments that had a vested interest in public surface of the water and harbor facilities showed a lukewarm attitude, whereas the ones that demanded the clear solution for the question of the title to the public surface of the water and reestablishment of harbor names took up active attitude. In addition, the government including the ministry in charge of the public surface of the water developed various arbitrating strategies such as hands-on staff meetings, subcommittees, workshops and etc.Third, in the conflict resolution and enduring stage, as harbor facilities continuously expanded, collateral financial benefit increased and the relationship between the interested parties and the people involved in the conflict became more complicated with more diversified conflicts.",2011,,{김봉준},,journal,9,1,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""159"", ""end_page"": ""179"", ""primary_date"": ""2011-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""A Study of Conflict on Public Surface of the Water using Policy Network Analysis"", ""primary_authors"": ""('김봉준',)""}"

Hydrochemical analyses and stable isotope monitoring were conducted to (a) determine groundwater recharge origin, mean groundwater age, and the main processes governing groundwater chemistry and the potential mixing of marine water and the influence of diffusive processes from the two surrounding aquitard layers. Hydrochemical data indicate that the main processes affecting the dissolved chemical composition include cation exchange, dissolution of carbonated and CO2, and silicate weathering. O-18 and H-2 compositions combined with C-14 data highlight the differences in climatic conditions between the recharge zone and the confined section of the aquifer, which is close to the Atlantic Ocean. Groundwater samples with C-14 ages from recent to 28,300years BP show a depleted isotopic trend ranging from -6.43 parts per thousand to -9.14 parts per thousand in O-18 and from -43.2 parts per thousand to -65.7 parts per thousand in H-2.

Although they have been found to play roles in regulating plant responses to environmental stresses, these roles still need to be explored, especially those pertaining to crops. Durum wheat is the second most widely produced cereal in the world. Complex, large and unsequenced genomes, in addition to a lack of genomic resources, hinder the molecular characterization of tolerance mechanisms. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of five TdWRKY genes from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum). A PCR-based screening of a T. turgidum BAC genomic library using primers within the conserved region of WRKY genes resulted in the isolation of five BAC clones. Following sequencing fully the five BACs, fine annotation through Triannot pipeline revealed 74.6% of the entire sequences as transposable elements and a 3.2% gene content with genes organized as islands within oceans of TEs. Each BAC clone harbored a TdWRKY gene. The study showed a very extensive conservation of genomic structure between TdWRKYs and their orthologs from Brachypodium, barley, and T. aestivum. The structural features of TdWRKY proteins suggested that they are novel members of the WRKY family in durum wheat. TdWRKY1/2/4, TdWRKY3, and TdWRKY5 belong to the group Ia, IIa, and IIc, respectively. Enrichment of cis-regulatory elements related to stress responses in the promoters of some TdWRKY genes indicated their potential roles in mediating plant responses to a wide variety of environmental stresses. TdWRKY genes displayed different expression patterns in response to salt stress that distinguishes two durum wheat genotypes with contrasting salt stress tolerance phenotypes. TdWRKY genes tended to react earlier with a down-regulation in sensitive genotype leaves and with an up-regulation in tolerant genotype leaves. The TdWRKY transcripts levels in roots increased in tolerant genotype compared to sensitive genotype. The present results indicate that these genes might play some functional role in the salt tolerance in durum wheat.",2017,,"{""Berges, Helene"",""Bouzayen, Mondher"",""Ghorbel, Abdel W"",""Makhloufi, Emna"",""Marande, William"",""Yousfi, Fatma-Ezzahra""}",,journal,7,,10.3389/fpls.2016.02034,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""primary_date"": ""2017-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Comparative Analysis of WRKY Genes Potentially Involved in Salt Stress Responses in Triticum turgidum L. ssp durum"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Berges, Helene', 'Bouzayen, Mondher', 'Ghorbel, Abdel W', 'Makhloufi, Emna', 'Marande, William', 'Yousfi, Fatma-Ezzahra')""}"

Such evolution of the sector could carry negative impacts on the environment and on portions of the society when unregulated and badly managed. In response to the explicit request of the Third Session of the Committee of Fisheries (COFI) Sub-Committee on Aquaculture to improve the management and enhance the socio-economic impacts of aquaculture, the Aquaculture Management and Conservation Service (FIMA) of the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department initiated in 2006 an effort to look into the development and application of the ecosystem approach to aquaculture. This activity is funded under a Japanese Trust Fund Project (Towards Sustainable Aquaculture: Selected Issues and Guidelines) and conducted in collaboration with the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Development and Planning Service (FIEP). Several activities have taken place to support sustainable aquaculture, including the workshop coorganized with the Universitat de les Illes Balears that took place from 7-11 May 2007 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain on 'Building and ecosystem approach to aquaculture'. The workshop participants, a multidisciplinary and multinational group of experts, agreed that: 'An ecosystem approach for aquaculture (EAA) is a strategy for the integration of the activity within the wider ecosystem in such a way that it promotes sustainable development, equity, and resilience of interlinked social and ecological systems'. Such strategy should be guided by three main principles that should ensure the contribution of aquaculture to sustainable development: i) aquaculture should be developed in the context of ecosystem functions and services with no degradation of these beyond their resilience capacity; ii) aquaculture should improve human wellbeing and equity for all relevant stakeholders; and iii) aquaculture should be developed in the context of (and integrated to) other relevant sectors. Three scales/levels of EAA application were identified and discussed: the farm; the waterbody and its watershed/ aquaculture zone; and the global, market-trade scale. These proceedings present the output of this workshop and include contributed papers on: concepts, principles, scales and management measures; human dimensions; economic implications; and legal implications; that are relevant for an ecosystem-based management to the sector. Two comprehensive review papers cover the status of brackish, marine and freshwater aquaculture under the light of an ecosystem-based management, indicating the major shortfalls and opportunities for such an approach are also included. Clearly, the implementation of the EAA will require changes in human behaviour and understanding of ecosystem's functioning; it will also require the development of institutions capable of integrating different sectors including aquaculture, especially in terms of shared agreed objectives and standards. As some of the reviews point out, scarce participatory processes, poor understanding of social sustainability requirements and poor governance hinders the widespread adoption of an ecosystem approach to aquaculture. Therefore more guidance is needed on these matters; these proceedings attempt to contribute to that by providing baseline information and some initial guidance.",2008,,,,book,,,,9789251060759,"FAO, Rome (Italy), [mailto:publications-sales@fao.org]",,"{""url"": ""http://pm6mt7vg3j.search.serialssolutions.com?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/Aquatic+Science+%26+Fisheries+Abstracts+"", ""pages"": ""1"", ""end_page"": ""221"", ""primary_date"": ""2008-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Building an ecosystem approach to aquaculture.

Despite little resolution over this issue, artificial reefs are often considered for use as compensatory mitigation for damaged marine resources. We estimate the quantitative enhancement of fish production under 4 plausible scenarios: attraction, enhancement, enhancement with fishing, and attraction with fishing. Our intent is not to resolve the attraction-enhancement debate, but to quantify the uncertainty associated with using artificial reefs as compensatory mitigation. Pertinent parameters for production calculations (fish density by size class, length-frequency distributions, diets, behaviors, age-specific growth and mortality rates) were obtained from syntheses of findings from artificial reef studies conducted in coastal waters of the southeastern USA and from species life-history profiles. Year-round reef inhabitants were separated into 2 groups: those whose recruitment appears to be limited by available reef habitat (only 2 taxa) and those not augmented in recruitment but potentially enhanced in realized production by provision of refuges and reef-associated prey (15 taxa). Estimates of enhanced production in this latter group were discounted by an index of reef exclusivity in diet to give production credit in proportion to consumption of reef-associated prey. Estimates of annual production enhancement per 10 m(2) of artificial reef ranged from 0 kg under the attraction scenario to 6.45 kg wet weight under the assumption of enhancement plus protection from fishing. Application of fishing reduced the enhancement estimate by 32 % to 4.44 kg 10 m(-2) yr(-1). A 4th scenario of attraction with fishing may yield a net decline in production of a similar magnitude. In contrast to many natural structural habitats (seagrass meadows, oyster reefs, salt marshes, mangroves) that have dramatically decreased over past decades and are clearly important nursery grounds, evidence is weak that habitat provided by artificial reefs on the shallow continental shelf of the southeastern USA is currently limiting to fish production. Until convincing empirical evidence appears, high scientific uncertainty limits confidence in using artificial reefs as compensatory mitigation. Furthermore, even if augmented production were achieved, managing fishing impacts would be critical to achieving the expected production benefit.",2003,,"{""Grabowski, J H"",""Lindberg, W J"",""Peterson, C H"",""Powers, S P""}",,journal,264,,10.3354/meps264265,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""265"", ""end_page"": ""277"", ""primary_date"": ""2003-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Estimating enhancement of fish production by offshore artificial reefs: uncertainty exhibited by divergent scenarios"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Grabowski, J H', 'Lindberg, W J', 'Peterson, C H', 'Powers, S P')""}"

Certainly, the most important issue for the understanding of biodiversity is the installing capacity of taxonomists. In fact, little is known concerning the number of taxonomists, scientific production, and the problems faced by taxonomists in each country. Once Brazilian biota is the richest of the world, it is undisputable that its knowledge is critical to understand world biodiversity patterns and to base conservation policies. We produced a technical report on Brazilian zoological taxonomy for the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology, which provided a more objective view upon the Brazilian biodiversity challenge. Brazil accounts for 6.67{\%} of the total species described (ca. 100,000 out of 1.5 million), but we expect a significantly higher number of species to be described. Brazil has 542 taxonomists: 415 with permanent positions, publishing in all fields of zoology. Their average age is 45-50 years old, with the majority still expecting to be active for more than 15-20 years. PhD Theses in taxonomy decreased during the 1990s, reflecting the worlds lack of interest in the area. The majority of taxonomists are concentrated in South East (51.7{\%}) and South (21.6{\%}) Brazil, and extensive regions, including biomes like Pantanal, Cerrado (Savannah), Caatinga and the Amazonian Rainforest, count with continuously fewer experts. Taxa with the larger number of taxonomists are ""fishes"" (53), Crustacea (39), Diptera (28), and Mollusca (27) although no taxon is considered to have enough experts. Several groups are in a more critical situation. Poorly known ecosystems and biomes are deep waters, continental shelf, northern coastline, semi-arid Caatinga, Amazon rainforest, though no region is considered adequately known. 7,320 species were described (1978-1995, 430/year), a rhythm very slow for the present needs, especially because many wild habitats are disappearing. Brazilian researchers have important contributions to make for their taxonomical groups, intensively collaborating with foreign colleagues. However, basic taxonomic work is still to be done: only a few groups have catalogues or manuals, basic taxonomic revisions are restricted (especially lacking for marine groups), databasing is needed for many museum collections. Brazilian researchers published 1801 papers (from ISI-Web of Knowledge, January/2000-March/2005), but only three states (S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais) were responsible for 70{\%} of these. The largest and most representative zoological collections are concentrated in a few cities (S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Bel{\'{e}}m, Manaus). There are 22 graduate programs of Zoology, 14 of them conferring PhDs, the majority of these in the same states in which the largest collections are found, and the best rated programs in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Paran{\'{a}} states. By the end of 2003, all programs together had 477 faculty professors, 480 MSc candidates and 486 PhD candidates. When compared to other countries, Brazil is in a rather good situation, although far from perfect. It is clear that world policies must be planned, but these will be more effective if countries know exactly how they can deal and can contribute to the global understanding on biodiversity. Our study also propose programs, strategies, and budgets based on the biodiversity data and needs. situa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o atual da taxonomia brasileira {\'{e}} um passo necess{\'{a}}rio para se estabelecer pol{\'{i}}ticas futuras para lidar com a biodiversidade.

Fish caught by recreational anglers in offshore waters of Massachusetts were sampled during the summers of 2007-2010. Diet analysis revealed that shortfin squid (Illex illecebrosus) and small pelagic crustaceans were principal prey to dolphinfish, yellowfin tuna, and albacore tuna. A wide variety of Sargassum-associated fishes were also important to dolphinfish and yellowfin tuna diets. Dietary (Schoener's index: 0.82-0.86) and isotopic niche (isotopic ellipse overlap: 53.6-64.7 %) overlap was high, and dolphinfish and tunas occupied equivalent trophic positions (TP = 3.4-3.6). Relative prey size in dolphinfish and yellowfin tuna diets exhibited convergence with ontogeny. Overall, dolphinfish had the greatest isotopic niche width, which was twice as large as yellowfin tuna and three times as large as albacore tuna; dolphinfish also consumed the greatest range of prey sizes.

Survival ranged from 1.0% to 12.7%, with lower stocking densities exhibiting higher survival. An exponential decay model revealed a significant influence of stocking density on survival, with 50 larvae/m(2) being predicted to provide the highest survival and the maximum yield being predicted to occur at 100/m(2). These results indicate that a stocking density of 100 larvae/m(2) should not be exceeded under the conditions described in this study.

It also prescribes robust recommendations that could be employed to save the Atlantic coast of Cameroon from industrial pollutants. After the participation of Cameroon in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the government took a significant step to overhaul its institutional framework, legal framework and policy framework vis-A-vis the regulation of industrial pollution. Under the auspices of the United Nation Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), the Gulf of Guinea Large Marine Ecosystem Project aimed at sustaining the health of the Atlantic coast of Cameroon by ensuring treatment of industrial wastes, oil spills, sewage and heavy metals was implemented (1995-1999). Based upon careful analysis, however, the paper argues that these efforts have had little or no discernable impacts and that industrial activities along the Atlantic coast of Cameroon are still a major threat to safety, health and the environment, With a considerable number of hurdles that still persist, sufficient environmental improvement in industrial pollution along the Atlantic coast or Cameroon is far-fetched. Nevertheless, the paper concludes that marked environmental improvement can be obtained if: (i) competent personnel are appointed in ministries that play an active role in mitigating industrial pollution (ii) research partnerships are forged with local universities (iii) industrial machinery and equipment are improved (iv) inter institutional conflicts are addressed (v) a more collaborative forum between stakeholders is established (vi) adequate monitoring is instituted.",2006,,"{""Alemagi, Dieudonne"",""Ertel, Juergen"",""Oben, Pius M""}",,journal,26,1,10.1007/s10669-006-5357-z,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""41"", ""end_page"": ""50"", ""primary_date"": ""2006-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Mitigating industrial pollution along the Atlantic coast of Cameroon: An overview of government efforts"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Alemagi, Dieudonne', 'Ertel, Juergen', 'Oben, Pius M')""}"

All the dietary indicator comparisons between pansteatitis-affected and healthy fish fail to support a systemic cause. Pansteatitis in Lake Loskop was linked to size and weight of O. mossambicus, but not to ontogenic age. Fish in Lake Loskop showed abnormally high omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios normally only found in marine fish with no significant difference in degree of assimilation of these fatty acids between pansteatitis-affected and healthy fish. This explains the vulnerability to, but not the occurrence of, pansteatitis. As a cause for the pansteatitis, these results point towards sporadic vitamin E-depleting trigger events, known sporadic fish die-off occurrences that provide surviving fish with a rich source of rancid fats on which to scavenge.

The Swagati project facilitated the formation of 11 CBOs through partnerships with local non-governmental organisations and meetings with groups of sex workers. Activities included peer-led outreach, information campaigns, institution building through community committees and capacity building for organisational development. In 2010, a Community Ownership and Preparedness Index tool assessed the CBOs in terms of leadership, democratic governance, decision making and others qualities. All except two CBOs scored in the 'promising' category. One of these CBOs moved to promising stage by the year 2011 indicating good progress, considering how recently they were established. The Community Ownership and Preparedness Index assessments of organisational strengths showed wide variations among the CBOs, despite the essentially similar organisational steps taken by the Swagati programme. A Behavioural Tracking Survey (2010) of individual CBO members also showed district-level differences in sex workers' expressions of confidence in collective action, participation in organisational activities and other indicators. Mobilising marginalised populations such as sex workers to form CBOs is a complex process and can be affected by many influences, including the qualities of CBO leadership.

Of these three potential methane sources, the role of vegetation in this flux is the least well understood. Both living and dead herbaceous vegetation have been demonstrated to act as methane sources, while knowledge regarding the contribution of woody vegetation to this flux is restricted to live plants. For dead woody vegetation to act as a methane source, two conditions must occur: (1) gas evolution/accumulation within the trunk airspace of a dead tree (e.g. snag) and (2) flux of this gas across the plant-atmosphere interface. The research presented here investigates condition (1) and provides evidence for a significant accumulation of both CH4 and CO2 in trunk airspace at water level (104.4 +/- 19.0 and 1785.5 +/- 470.7 mu L L-1 for CH4 and CO2 respectively) and CO2 at breast height (1257.6 +/- 294.4 mu L L-1) as compared to ambient air immediately outside the trunk (ca. 3 and 370 mu L L-1 for CH4 and CO2 respectively) in dead snags located within two ghost forest landscapes at the Timberlake Observatory for Wetland Restoration (Tyrrell County, North Carolina).

Currently, developed countries have standards of living, reduced population growth rates and are major consumers of imported resources. In contrast, less developed nations are largely dependent upon natural resources within their borders, have a lower overall standard of living and high population growth rates which threaten sustainability of natural resources. The present socio-economic plight of people living in parts of the Lake Malawi basin, including those along the lake shore, suggests that they might be caught in a Malthusian trap. The SADC/GEF, Lake Malawi/Nyasa Biodiversity Conservation Project has a responsibility to conserve biodiversity and develop a strategy for sustainable use of resources. The project therefore has to face the challenges of disentangling populations from the 'trap'. Land-use practices throughout the catchment are increasing the rate and extent of erosion. The impacts of high sediment loads, changes in river behaviour and fishing pressure on riverine and potamodromous fishes are marked, but not understood in detail. Sediment plumes enter the lake from rivers and behave in differing ways depending on the characteristics of the river and lake at any particular time. Their impact on the physical and biological aspects of the limnology of the lake, on fishes and on the fisheries is an intriguing and important study. Probably, however, the greatest impacts on the fishery arise from fishing pressure which appears to be threatening, seriously, several fisheries and even the species themselves. The challenge of addressing these factors, given growing demand for fish and current demographic patterns, has to be met by participatory problem solving, involving communities which live along the lake shore and in distant areas where the major markets remotely impose demands for fish. The project's role is to provide the knowledge base for informed decisions, recommendations for conservation and sustainable use and to bridge the gap between science and community awareness. The development of community-driven conservation ethics, so that systems of open access to resources are replaced by alternatives which are governed by the villagers themselves, is a possible solution. Despite great success of the theatre group and other educational programmes within the project, it is recognized that the complex nature of the lake, the fisheries, and the different cultural and demographic circumstances within each province of the lake will require a multifaceted solution which may take years to develop.

Infectious disease emergencies may arise within a country through incursions of known exotic diseases (transboundary aquatic animal diseases, TAADs), by a sudden change in the behaviour or distribution of endemic diseases, or via the appearance of previously unrecognized diseases. Effective emergency preparedness through contingency planning, early detection and a rapid response is critical to the successful management of such disease outbreaks. A strong national approach to contingency planning is essential to ensure that the necessary operational capability is in place so that early detection and effective responses are achieved. Recovery from an emergency disease response must be followed by measures to ensure that freedom from the particular disease is again maintained.Having the capability to deal with emergency diseases involves systematic planning, training, and simulation exercises (field trials or ""dummy runs""), as well as having access to an appropriate level of resources, including trained personnel, essential equipment and the necessary financial and legal mechanisms.

However, as medium was replaced by a simulated tidal cycle, the observed stimulation of CO2 production decreased, and the addition of strain E12V had no greater effect on total CO2 production than the addition of inorganic nutrients alone.

Two general size classes of clams were used, mean length ca. 40.0 mm (41.9 mm) and mean length ca. 20.0 mm (22.3 mm and 19.0 mm), to see if growth responses were the same for large- and small-sized clams. Seagrass density, length and species composition as well as sediment characteristics were measured at high- and low-energy sites to determine if changes in seagrass and/or sediment dynamics could explain observed growth patterns. The incidence of siphon cropping was also evaluated as a potential influence on clam growth. Large clams grew faster inside than outside vegetation at both high- and low-energy sites. Within the vegetation, growth of large clams was faster in medium-sized patches of seagrass (2-3 m across) than in small patches (1 m across) and was intermediate in large patches ({\textgreater} 4-5 m across). There was no apparent correlation between seagrass shoot density, blade length, or species composition and growth of clams in patches of different size. Growth of small clams (22.3 mm) within seagrass was independent of the two seagrass patch sizes tested (large vs. small), but did vary among sites. Growth of clams was not correlated with differences in shoot density, blade length or species composition among sites. Growth of small clams (19.0 mm) also varied with energy regime and with presence/absence of vegetation. Small clams grew significantly more within seagrass under both high- and low-energy conditions, but the effect was more pronounced at high-energy sites than at low. Seagrass shoot density, blade length, and species composition did not vary between high and low energy regimes, but did vary among sites from the beginning to the end of the experiment. Long-term averages of sediment stability based on grain size characteristics suggest that the baffling effect of seagrass varies greatly with energy regime. Vegetated sediments at high-energy sites contained significantly more fine material than the unvegetated sediments while there was no difference in the fine fraction between vegetated and unvegetated sediments at low-energy sites. The difference in sediment stability between seagrass cover under high- and low-energy conditions may contribute to the magnitude of the difference in the growth response of small clams to the presence of vegetation at exposed and protected sites. Other factors also contributed to the increased growth of clams in seagrass beds at the protected sites where grain size analysis suggests similar sedimentary dynamics both within and outside of the vegetation. Mean adjusted siphon weights, however, for both large and small clams were independent of seagrass cover and energy regime implying that siphon nipping differences did not influence growth patterns of clams. Based on this study, and previous investigations, the effect of seagrass cover on growth of clams appears to be the result of a complex interaction among food supply, predation disturbance, and sediment stability with the relative importance of these processes varying with size of the clam, hydrographic regime, and local site differences.",1996,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,54,,10.1357/0022240963213439,0022-2402,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""161"", ""end_page"": ""185"", ""primary_date"": ""1996-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""The effects of seagrass patch size and energy regime on growth of a suspension-feeding bivalve"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

This paper identifies some of the main issues relevant to the management of environmental impacts of marine aquaculture; reviews EU and international policy and regulations in this context and provides one example of a strategy for the management of the environmental impacts of marine aquaculture by reference to the marine aquaculture industry in Scotland. In conclusion, it examines a number of current, key environmental concerns pertaining to the impact and regulation of marine aquaculture, which whilst being the subject of divergent views, are pivotal to the development of the industry. Recommendations for systems, procedures and research to address these concerns are identified. The paper is primarily concerned with marine finfish culture, although brief reference is made to shellfish culture. The control of diseases of finfish and shellfish is outside the scope of the paper, although brief consideration is given to current concerns relating to sea lice (predominantly Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestations in salmonids.

In this sandy area, high precipitation is compensated by a rapid draining through the ground and by relief factors. Changes in habitat during the period of investigation are described. Changes in agriculture seem too small to have been the cause of the observed regression in the sample population. The number of .male..male. dwindled significantly during the investigated time span, but the number of .female..female. remained about the same. In all years there were more .male..male. than .female..female., though this difference was gradually diminished because of the regression of the .male..male.. The mean breeding success reached about 87% of the average population size. Weather conditions at the time of the earliest arrival in the breeding area are described. The average 1st arrival date for the .male..male. was April 27th. The mean arrival date of the .male..male. was May 3rd. Normally, all territories were occuppied before May 12th. The territorial pattern was very conservative, and the social attraction as well as the concentration of positive ecological factors led to a cumulative occupation of territories. The clutches were generally completed around 16 days after arrival of the .male..male. or the pairs. Later arriving .male..male. showed the same time lag between arrival and completed clutch. The average date for clutch completion was May 19th (normal broods) and the mean hatching date was May 29th. The main part of the nestling period was in the 1st decade of June. A distinction is made between broods with synchronous and graduated beginnings. A time coincidence between the nestling period and the late spring was observed only in 7 of 13 yr. Precipitation was a main factor regarding losses of broods, whereas the air temperature was less important. In bad years there was repeated total loss of broods. The replacement broods were smaller and less successful. If the regression continues, the population will disappear between 1985 and 1990. The most important protection measure would be the maintaining of oak (Quercus robur) in the habitat.",1977,,"{""Conrads, K""}",,journal,98,3,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""81"", ""end_page"": ""105"", ""primary_date"": ""1977-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""RESULTS OF A MEDIUM-TERM POPULATION SURVEY 1964-1976 OF THE ORTOLAN BUNTING EMBERIZA-HORTULANA ON A SAMPLE PLOT IN THE SENNE OSTMUENSTERLAND"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Conrads, K',)""}"

Many studies have shown that waves and currents are able to erode mussels from an intertidal mussel bed, but here it is demonstrated that in temperate regions ice action can be important as well. These findings result from a 27-month-long monitoring campaign on a mature intertidal mussel bed in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Daily camera observations revealed two periods in which significant erosion occurred. The first event occurred in a period during which the bed was covered by ice. Ice action resulted in an initial decrease of 19% in mussel covered area around the monitoring station. The losses were concentrated in three erosion hotspots of which the largest two were located close to the beds' edge. Around these hotspots, up to 03 m high ridges of piled up mussels had formed, with the highest ridges located westward of these erosion gaps. The observed topographic changes support the view that the mechanism by which the bed was damaged was, at least partly, due to physical disturbance by scouring ice. Recovery of mussel cover was limited in the 19 months following the ice action event. Due to sedimentation and reorganization of the mussels, initial relief inside the mussel bed was reduced again and mussels spread out over a larger area. Height differences between uncovered parts and mussel covered parts increased as a result of sedimentation in mussel covered areas. Wave action during a storm period caused a further reduction in mussel cover. Especially areas that were previously elevated by ice action suffered from large losses. Wave erosion occurred during multiple wind events, causing initially small erosion gaps to expand outward and increase in extent. The results suggest a twofold impact of wave and ice action on mussel bed cover: firstly, by directly eroding mussels from mussel beds; secondly, by indirectly increasing the exposure of mussel beds to wave induced bed shear stresses.

They are considered as renewable and environmentally friendly technologies to use the sea and its resources (e.g. offshore wind farms, bioenergy production or ocean fertilization). While most green technologies are currently at an embryonic stage, it remains to see whether such technologies will be commercialized successfully. Given this situation, this research broaches two legal issues for the green technology development.First, this research addresses the legal nature of the experimental activities of green technologies on the ocean. Principally, it is reasonable to consider those activities as marine scientific research which is governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea because the Convention does not pose any specific limitations to the marine scientific research. However, the purpose, means and scope of the marine scientific research involving the green technology are regulated by the decisions provided under the Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters, to its 2006 Protocol and to the Convention on Biological Diversity. These decisions from the Conferences do not modify legally the definition of marine scientific research. However, they can serve as guidelines that states are encouraged to consider in the application of green technology on the ocean.Secondly, the contemporary science suffers from lack of knowledge which assesses the possible impact of green technology on the marine environment. Therefore, the precautionary principle may be convincingly applicable to dealing with such scientific uncertainty. However, this principle could be controversial because conventions interpret it in different ways. To be specific, this principle in some conventions may work to justify the development of green technologies, whereas it in others seems to curb vigorous research activities on the ocean. This apparent discrepancy can be resolved if one interprets the precautionary principle as establishing procedural criteria, rather than as creating specific obligations of conduct. Furthermore, the Article 31(3)(c) of Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the principle of harmonization could be another solution to avoid conflicting interpretation found in different conventions.",2012,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,66,,NA,1598-1584,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""169"", ""end_page"": ""203"", ""primary_date"": ""2012-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Understanding of the green technology on the ocean in the international law"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

We present major element concentrations, together with Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, of siliciclastic bulk sediments to define sediment provenance and chemical weathering intensity. These data indicate preferential sediment generation in the steep, wetter upper reaches of the Song Gianh. In contrast, detrital zircon U-Pb ages argue for significant flux from the drier, northern Rao Tro tributary. We propose that this mismatch represents disequilibrium in basin erosion patterns driven by changing monsoon strength and the onset of agriculture across the region. Detrital apatite fission track and Be-10 data from modern sediment support slowing of regional bedrock exhumation rates through the Cenozoic. If the Song Gianh is representative of coastal Vietnam then the coastal mountains may have produced around 132000-158000km(3) of the sediment now preserved in the Song Hong-Yinggehai Basin (17-21{\%} of the total), the primary depocenter of the Red River. This flux does not negate the need for drainage capture in the Red River to explain the large Cenozoic sediment volumes in that basin but does partly account for the discrepancy between preserved and eroded sediment volumes. OSL ages from terraces cluster in the Early Holocene (7.4-8.5ka), Pre-Industrial (550-320year BP) and in the recent past (ca. 150year BP).

Foredune, interdune, and backdune habitats common to most coastal dunes have very different vegetation, likely because of the interplay among plant succession, exposure, disturbance, and resource availability. However, surprisingly few long-term data are available describing dune vegetation patterns. A nine-year census of 294 plots on St. George Island, Florida suggests that the major climatic drivers of vegetation patterns vary with habitat. Community structure is correlated with the elevation, soil moisture, and percent soil ash of each 1 m2 plot. Major storms reduce species richness in all three habitats. Principle coordinate analysis suggests that changes in the plant communities through time are caused by climatic events: changes in foredune vegetation are correlated with temperature and summer precipitation, interdune vegetation with storm surge, and backdune vegetation with precipitation and storm surge. We suggest that the plant communities in foredune, interdune, and backdune habitats tend to undergo succession toward particular compositions of species, with climatic disturbances pushing the communities away from these more deterministic trajectories. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",2009,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,206,,10.1007/s11258-009-9626-z,13850237,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72249102118%7B%5C&%7Ddoi=10.1007%7B%5C%25%7D2Fs11258-009-9626-z%7B%5C&%7DpartnerID=40%7B%5C&%7Dmd5=1ac5e9ad00ba7e2b4b5caebabe61d002"", ""pages"": ""97"", ""end_page"": ""104"", ""primary_date"": ""2009-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Climate and coastal dune vegetation: Disturbance, recovery, and succession"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

In the ocean, many species display life histories that separate juveniles from adults. For pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), infection of juvenile salmon in early marine life occurs near salmon sea-cage aquaculture sites and is associated with declining abundance of wild salmon. Here, we develop a theoretical model for the pink salmon/sea lice host-parasite system and use it to explore the effects of aquaculture hosts, acting as reservoirs, on dynamics. Because pink salmon have a 2-year lifespan, even- and odd-year lineages breed in alternate years in a given river. These lineages can have consistently different relative abundances, a phenomenon termed ""line dominance"". These dominance relationships between host lineages serve as a useful probe for the dynamical effects of introducing aquaculture hosts into this host-parasite system. We demonstrate how parasite spillover (farm-to-wild transfer) and spillback (wild-to-farm transfer) with aquaculture hosts can either increase or decrease the line dominance in an affected wild population. The direction of the effect depends on the response of farms to wild-origin infection. If aquaculture parasites are managed to a constant abundance, independent of the intensity of infections from wild to farm, then line dominance increases. On the other hand, if wild-origin parasites on aquaculture hosts are proportionally controlled to their abundance then line dominance decreases.",2012,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,5,,10.1007/s12080-011-0122-4,1874-1738,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""231"", ""end_page"": ""252"", ""primary_date"": ""2012-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Aquaculture-induced changes to dynamics of a migratory host and specialist parasite: a case study of pink salmon and sea lice"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Prior to 1994, skate in Canadian waters were taken only as bycatch, most of which were discarded. However with the establishment of a directed fishery for skate on the southwestern Grand Bank and southern St. Pierre Bank in 1994, domestic landings have averaged about 3,000 t annually. This paper represents the third assessment of this ""new"" fishery. This evaluation has shown that biomass indices, following a decline to their lowest historic level may have stabilized in recent years. However, a change in survey gear (in the fall of 1995) with different catch characteristics has created a discontinuity in the time series and prevents a comparison between the two periods. Survey data from the fall was examined for the first time. It was found that the spring survey previously used to estimate biomass and abundance may not include a substantial portion of the population. On average, fall survey estimates of biomass were 40% higher. In addition, differences in spring and fall distributions and seasonal change in bycatch rates of skate from Grand Bank slope fisheries suggests that thorny skate migrate toward the shelf edge in the winter, a portion of the population out of the surveyed area. They re-aggregate onto the bank in midsummer and throughout the fall. Analysis of lengths taken during the research surveys have covered a consistent range since 1985 with main modes occurring at 15 to 32 cm and 65 to 83 cm, the latter comprising mature fish. A recent increase in proportion of larger skates in the catches is noted. A spatial analysis of skate size shows a degree of segregation by size, the largest fish tending to aggregate along the southwestern shelf edge with a mix of sizes in the bank aggregation to the north. A comparison of distribution of skate from surveys data with commercial grounds shows that the Canadian fleet fishes about 1/3rd of the area of high concentration of skate in the spring, primarily along the shelf edge where the skate are largest. The Spanish fleet fishes a separate area on the Southeast Shoal outside 200 miles in the fall taking smaller fish.Original Abstract: L'exploitation de la raie epineuse s'est accrue au cours des dernieres annees suite a l'appauvrissement des ressources traditionnelles en poisson de fond des eaux de Terre-Neuve. Avant 1994, les captures de raie en eaux canadiennes n'etaient constituees que de prises accidentelles dont la majorite etait rejetee. Les debarquements canadiens de raie ont cependant atteint une valeur annuelle moyenne de 3 000 t environ suite a l'instauration, en 1994, d'une peche dirigee de la raie dans la partie sud-ouest du Grand Banc et la partie sud du banc Saint-Pierre. Le present document constitue la troisieme evaluation de cette 'nouvelle' peche. Il y est montre que les indices de biomasse pourraient s'etre stabilises au cours des dernieres annees apres avoir subi un declin au niveau historique le plus faible. Par ailleurs, une modification de l'engin utilise pour les releves (a l'automne de 1995) et dont les caracteristiques de capture sont differentes a donne lieu a une discontinuite au sein de la serie chronologique qui interdit d'effectuer une comparaison entre les deux periodes. Les donnees des releves d'automne ont ete examinees pour la premiere fois. Il s'est avere que le releve de printemps anterieurement utilise pour estimer la biomasse et l'abondance pourrait avoir ignore une partie appreciable de la population . En moyenne, les estimations de biomasse du releve d'automne etaient de 40 % superieures. En outre, les ecarts entre les distributions de printemps et d'automne et des variations saisonnieres des taux des captures accidentelles de raie par les peches effectuees sur la pente du Grand Banc portent a croire que la raie epineuse migre vers la bordure du plateau en hiver et qu'une partie de la population pourrait donc etre a l'exterieur de la zone du releve. Les raies se regroupe t de nouveau sur le banc a la mi-ete et au cours de l'automne. L'analyse des longueurs determinees pendant les releves de recherche montre l'existence d'une gamme uniforme depuis 1995, les principaux modes se trouvant de 15 a 32 cm et de 65 a 83 cm, ce dernier groupe correspondant aux poissons matures. On a note recemment une augmentation de la proportion des raies de plus grandes tailles au sein des captures.

This was done to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic, atmospherically derived acid deposition and to enable restoration of a reproducing population of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis. Brook trout, which had been historically present in this stream, had been absent for at least the last 20 years. Water quality improved immediately following liming, and the effects of the direct application have lasted 44 months to date. The mean monthly water chemistry difference between the acidic control and upper sampling sites (1.1 km below the liming site) was an increase in pH (+1.14 units), acid neutralizing capacity (ANC; +49 mueq/L), Ca2+ (+73 mueq/L), and Ca: H ratio (+382) and a decrease in total Al (-279 mugm/L). The mean monthly difference between the acidic control and the lower sampling sites (1.8 km below the liming site) was an increase in pH (+0.62 units), ANC (+30 mueq/L), Ca2+ (+40 mueq/L), and Ca: H ratio (+422) and a decrease in AlT (-155 mug/L). One month after liming, native brook trout were transplanted into Fridley Run from a nearby circumneutral stream. A brook trout year-class was produced in 1994 and every year since (1995-1997). Offspring from the originally transplanted brook trout have survived and successfully reproduced, thus accomplishing a primary objective of the study. Populations of brook trout in the study sections increased from 0 to 54/100 m2. Transplanted nongame fishes survived in the stream but did not reproduce.

Entomological risk assessment of these diseases remains scarce for much of East Africa and Kenya even in the dengue fever-prone urban coastal areas. Focusing on major cities of Kenya, we compared DEN and YF risk in Kilifi County (DEN-outbreak-prone), and Kisumu and Nairobi Counties (no documented DEN outbreaks). We surveyed water-holding containers for mosquito immature (larvae/pupae) indoors and outdoors from selected houses during the long rains, short rains and dry seasons (100 houses/season) in each County from October 2014-June 2016. House index (HI), Breteau index (BI) and Container index (CI) estimates based on Aedes (Stegomyia) immature infestations were compared by city and season. Aedes aegypti and Aedes bromeliae were the main Stegomyia species with significantly more positive houses outdoors (212) than indoors (88) (n = 900) (.2 = 60.52, P <0.0001). Overall, Ae. aegypti estimates of HI (17.3 vs 11.3) and BI (81.6 vs 87.7) were higher in Kilifi and Kisumu, respectively, than in Nairobi (HI, 0.3; BI, 13).

Geolocations of tagged fish were estimated based on light-based longitude and sea surface temperature-based latitude algorithms. The horizontal and vertical movement patterns of Pacific bluefin were examined in relation to oceanographic conditions and the occurrence of feeding events inferred from thermal fluctuations in the peritoneal cavity. In summer, fish were located primarily in the Southern California Bight and over the continental shelf of Baja California, where juvenile Pacific bluefin use the top of the water column, undertaking occasional, brief forays to depths below the thermocline. In autumn, bluefin migrated north to the waters off the Central California coast when thermal fronts form as the result of weakened equatorward wind stress. An examination of ambient and peritoneal temperatures revealed that bluefin tuna fed during this period along the frontal boundaries. In mid-winter, the bluefin returned to the Southern California Bight possibly because of strong downwelling and depletion of prey species off the Central California waters. The elevation of the mean peritoneal cavity temperature above the mean ambient water temperature increased as ambient water temperature decreased. The ability of juvenile bluefin tuna to maintain a thermal excess of 10 degrees C occurred at ambient temperatures of 11-14 degrees C when the fish were off the Central California coast.

This species feeds on small, schooling fishes and zooplankton, and nests primarily on the moss-covered branches of large, old-growth conifers, and also, in some parts of its range, on the ground. We reviewed existing information on this species to evaluate its current status in the northern part of its range - Alaska (U.S.) and British Columbia (Canada). Within the southern part of its range (Washington, Oregon, and California, U.S.), the Marbled Murrelet was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1993, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) needed information on the species throughout its range for ESA deliberations. We compiled published information on the conservation status, population biology, foraging ecology, population genetics, population status and trends, demography, marine and nesting habitat characteristics, threats, and ongoing conservation efforts for Marbled Murrelets in Alaska and British Columbia. We conducted a new genetic study using samples from a segment of the range that had not been included in previous studies (Washington, Oregon) and additional nuclear intron and microsatellite markers. We also analyzed available at-sea survey data from several locations for trend. To understand the reasonableness of the empirical trend data, we developed demographic models incorporating stochasticity to discern what population trends were possible by chance. The genetic studies substantially confirmed previous findings on population structure in the Marbled Murrelet. Our present work finds three populations: (1) one comprising birds in the central and western Aleutian Islands; (2) one comprising birds in central California; and (3) one comprising birds within the center of the range from the eastern Aleutians to northern California. Our knowledge of genetic structure within this central population is limited and it requires additional study. Compiling available abundance information, we estimated that in the recent past, Marbled Murrelets in Alaska numbered on the order of 1 million birds. We were unable to generate a similar estimate for historical population size in British Columbia. Using trend information from at-sea surveys spanning a wide geographic range in Alaska, murrelet numbers declined significantly at five of eight trend sites at annual rates of -5.4 to -12.7 percent since the early 1990s. Applying these rates of decline to the historical population estimate, the current murrelet population in Alaska is projected to be on the order of 270,000 birds. This represents an overall population decline of about 70 percent during the past 25 years. In British Columbia, available trend data indicate that murrelet populations there have experienced similar declines. We updated a recent (2002) population estimate for British Columbia, concluding that there are now between 54,000 and 92,000 murrelets in British Columbia. The rates of decline we observed are within, but at the high end of, a range of rates expected by chance. Given that declines were estimated for sites over essentially the entire northern range of the species, there is cause for concern about the species' status. In their marine habitats, Marbled Murrelets overlap with salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) gillnetting operations in British Columbia and in Alaska (especially in Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska), and annual bycatch mortality is likely in the low thousands per year, although bycatch rates are difficult to measure. The species' inshore distribution coincides with high levels of vessel traffic and makes them especially vulnerable to both chronic oil pollution and to catastrophic spills (e.g., the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill [EVOS] in south-central Alaska, which is estimated to have killed 12,000 to 15,000 murrelets). In their forested nesting habitats, Marbled Murrelets have lost about 15 percent of their suitable nesting habitat in Southeast Alaska, and 33 to 49 percent in British Columbia, from industrial-scale logging within the past half century. Increased predation also may be a threat to murrelet populations, related to fragmentation and edge effects from logging and development, and recent population increases observed for some important murrelet predators, including Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Common Ravens (Corvus corax), and Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri). Nesting habitat losses cannot explain the declines observed in areas where industrial logging has not occurred on a large scale (e.g., Prince William Sound) or at all (Glacier Bay). The apparent change in population size and rates of decline reported for the Marbled Murrelet are large, and we therefore considered alternative explanations and precedents for changes of similar magnitude in other marine wildlife populations in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. The declines are likely real, and related to combined and cumulative effects from climate-related changes in the marine ecosystem (most likely the 1977 regime shift) and human activities (logging, gillnet bycatch, oil pollution). Much uncertainty about the decline could be alleviated by continuing to repeat boat surveys in Prince William Sound and lower Cook Inlet, and by repeating the boat survey of Southeast Alaska that was conducted in 1994. This survey used a statistically sound design and covered the region that has been and likely remains the center of the species' abundance. Important questions remain to be addressed about methods for measuring population status and change, adult mortality (major sources, density dependence, seasonal concordance), and the movements of wintering populations.",2007,,"{""Arimitsu, M L"",""Birt, T P"",""Bixler, K S"",""Burger, A E"",""Drew, G S"",""Friesen, V L"",""Harding, A M A"",""Hatch, S A"",""Kuletz, K J"",""Piatt, J F""}",,journal,2006-1387,,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""i"", ""end_page"": ""-xiv, 1--258"", ""primary_date"": ""2007-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Status review of the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in Alaska and British Columbia"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Arimitsu, M L', 'Birt, T P', 'Bixler, K S', 'Burger, A E', 'Drew, G S', 'Friesen, V L', 'Harding, A M A', 'Hatch, S A', 'Kuletz, K J', 'Piatt, J F')""}"

The gulf coast is experiencing rapid population growth and associated land cover/land use change. Mobile Bay, AL is a designated pilot region of the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) and is the focus area of many current NASA and NOAA studies, for example. This is a critical region, both ecologically and economically to the entire United States because it has the fourth largest freshwater inflow in the continental USA, is a vital nursery habitat for commercially and recreational important fisheries, and houses a working waterfront and port that is expanding. Watershed and hydrodynamic modeling has been performed for Mobile Bay to evaluate the impact of land use change in Mobile and Baldwin counties on the aquatic ecosystem. Watershed modeling using the Loading Simulation Package in C++ (LSPC) was performed for all watersheds contiguous to Mobile Bay for land use Scenarios in 1948, 1992, 2001, and 2030. The Prescott Spatial Growth Model was used to project the 2030 land use scenario based on observed trends. All land use scenarios were developed to a common land classification system developed by merging the 1992 and 2001 National Land Cover Data (NLCD). The LSPC model output provides changes in flow, temperature, sediments and general water quality for 22 discharge points into the Bay. These results were inputted in the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Computer Code (EFDC) hydrodynamic model to generate data on changes in temperature, salinity, and sediment concentrations on a grid with four vertical profiles throughout the Bay's aquatic ecosystems. The models were calibrated using in-situ data collected at sampling stations in and around Mobile bay. This phase of the project has focused on sediment modeling because of its significant influence on light attenuation which is a critical factor in the health of submerged aquatic vegetation. The impact of land use change on sediment concentrations was evaluated by analyzing the LSPC and EFDC sediment simulations for the four land use scenarios. Such analysis was also performed for storm and non-storm periods. In- situ data of total suspended sediments (TSS) and light attenuation were used to develop a regression model to estimate light attenuation from TSS. This regression model was used to derive marine light attenuation estimates throughout Mobile bay using the EFDC TSS outputs. The changes in sediment concentrations and associated impact on light attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem were used to perform an ecological analysis to evaluate the impact on seagreasses and Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) habitat. This is the key product benefiting the Mobile Bay coastal environmental managers that integrates the influences of sediments due to land use driven flow changes with the restoration potential of SAVs.

Its relatively dry western slopes have attracted farmers since colonial times. The area is tropical, but relatively dry, and consequently supports a tropical fauna. By the mid-1960s cotton was cultivated on 80% of the arable land along the Pacific coast which led to widespread deforestation, erosion, and biocide contamination, and reduced the original vegetation cover by 90%. In 1994 the country had approximately 155,000 ha of mangroves, about 45% of which were located on the Pacific Coast, but this has been reduced by over half by deforestation. The Gulf of Fonseca is a deep embayment and is one of the most important coastal ecosystems of the region, shared with Honduras and El Salvador. Several rivers drain into it, but these rivers now also deposit large quantities of sediments and pollutants arising from changes in drainage regimes and up-hill deforestation. It is heavily populated by almost 500,000 people; it is economically important because it is a place of trade and commercial activities between the three countries, and opportunities to exploit the natural resources of this rich environment have attracted many people who have in turn further compounded the degradation and loss of valuable natural resources. Shrimp aquaculture is very important here. Several hundred species of demersal fish are commonly taken as by-catch in the shrimp fisheries, but do not sustain commercial fisheries. Significant fisheries on small coastal pelagic fish, such as the Central Pacific anchovetta and Pacific thread herring, have existed in the Gulf of Panama since the 1950s, but currently most of the production is used for fish meal and oil. The most valuable fish off Nicaragua are tuna (yellowfin, skipjack, and bigeye tuna) caught mainly by fleets from overseas. Serious population-related problems include pollution, lack of facilities for solid waste disposal, lack of basic infrastructure, and lack of integrated planning to prepare for natural hazards, problems related to mining, and cultural displacement of natives. Several areas of Nicaraguan law need modification to effectively manage the nation's coastal resources. Therefore, integrated management is needed to ensure that the potential value of the natural resources contributes to the sustainable development of the Pacific coast. Some of Nicaragua's Pacific marine and coastal resources have been over-exploited, degraded or destroyed. However, they offer great potential to improve the quality of life for the Nicaraguan people and the condition of the Pacific Central American Coastal Large Marine Ecosystem. The government understands the value of these resources and has received excellent natural resource management guidance and technical assistance. Preventing mismanagement and destruction of these resources and ecosystems, which has occurred in other Central American countries, now depends on effective government and the ability of the Nicaraguan people to work together as a united nation.",2000,,"{""Gallucci, V F"",""Jameson, S C"",""Robleto, J A""}",,journal,,,,,,,"{""url"": ""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033664964&partnerID=40&md5=dfe6d9607418f58a79a3548a065c3531"", ""pages"": ""531"", ""end_page"": ""543"", ""primary_date"": ""2000-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Nicaragua: Pacific Coast"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Gallucci, V F', 'Jameson, S C', 'Robleto, J A')""}"

Plots of fish abundance versus fish size showed that vegetated sites had higher densities of fish, smaller fish, and greater species richness than unvegetated sites. Using information on fish biomass (B) and fish size (W), a production index (PI) was calculated as log(10) PI = -0.35 log(10) W + 0.90 log(10) B. The production index was significantly related to macrophyte density, phosphorus, slope of the littoral area, and fish species richness. The regression model explained 61% of the variability in PI if species richness was included but only 43% if habitat features alone were used.

This approach was tested using data from a survey and subsequent resurvey of Scottish coastal vegetation. Location: Scotland, UK. Results: Fixed dunes, slacks, unimproved grassland and mires showed the highest functional overlap through time (high correspondence in convex hull position between two surveys), while salt marsh, improved grassland and heath showed the lowest. Fixed dune was the most stable in terms of retaining the highest proportion of the original convex hull, while salt marsh was least stable. Salt marsh also showed the highest new functional space occupied, whilst mires and slacks showed the least colonization by functionally distinct species. Generally sites on the west coast of Scotland were most stable, while those on the east showed the greatest functional changes. Assessing functional beta-diversity provided a different picture to assessing species beta-diversity; high species turnover might have little impact on the functional characteristics of the vegetation, whereas the invasion of one functionally different species can have a sizeable impact on ecosystem processes.

In Indonesia, Enhalus acoroides is the climax seagrass species and the target species for restoration. However, optimal conditions for seed storage are not known. The aim of this study was to determine optimal storage conditions for E. acoroides seeds to maximize germination and growth. Seed germination was examined under different lengths of storage and storage temperatures (room and refrigerator) for Enhalus fruits (with the seed inside). Enhalus seeds did not survive well and turned black after 2 days in the refrigerator (4 degrees C). Seeds held in room temperature (similar to 30 degrees C) for 2-11 days survived and grew to seedlings. Survival of the seedlings in the field was also correlated with the performance of the seedling when raised for 10 weeks in the laboratory. Seedlings stored in refrigerator had reduced survival (87.5{\%}) in the field compared to seedlings stored 2-5 days in room temperature (100{\%} survival). However, seeds stored up to 8 days, even at room temperature, produced seedlings that did not survive well either in the laboratory or in the field (survival was less than 20{\%}). Our results indicate that long-term seed storage in the laboratory will not be feasible for restoration. Because using seeds for restoration is important for maintaining genetic diversity, the establishment of a seedling nursery in the field provides a viable alternative for Enhalus restoration, although it will be logistically more challenging than a seed storage bank.

In the north and west of Scotland, candidate areas sometimes include maerl beds as these calcareous algal deposits tend to occur in areas sheltered from wave action with strong tidal water movement that may reduce the build-up of organic matter. Maerl beds are a UK Biodiversity Action Plan habitat and this report is the culmination of collaborative research between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Marine Harvest (Scotland) (MHS). Previously, it was unknown whether maerl beds would be resilient to fish farm operation, by virtue of the strong tidal flows that typify maerl grounds, or whether these habitats were easily degraded. Experimental evidence from laboratory studies has, however, shown that maerl is particularly sensitive to siltation and lowered oxygen levels (Wilson et al., 2004). This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of fish farm deposition on maerl beds. Main findings This study undertook fieldwork in May and June 2003 to investigate the impact of fish farm deposition on maerl beds at three fish farms in Shetland, Orkney and South Uist. The study has revealed the following findings: l All three fish farm sites had a significant build-up of feed and faeces trapped within maerl near the cages. Evidence of gross organic enrichment was recorded up to 100m away from the cage edges. The organic enrichment was found to affect a number of different aspects of the benthic community. l Deposition from the fish farms affected the percentage of maerl on the seabed that was live versus dead. All three sites had more dead/dying maerl near to the cages than at the reference sites and at stations distant from the cages. Live maerl close to cage edges had a mottled, unhealthy appearance due to phycobilin pigment loss. l Close to the cage edges, increased abundances of scavenging macrofauna were recorded (eg Buccinum undatum, Pagurus bernhardus, Cancer pagurus, Necora puber, Asterias rubens). Between 10 and 100 times as many scavenging macrofauna were recorded close to the cages than at reference sites. l Marked reductions in species diversity of infaunal communities associated with the maerl were recorded around the fish farms in Shetland and Orkney. Organic enrichment effects on community structure were also noted around the fish farms in Shetland and South Uist. Small scavenging species increased greatly in abundance near the fish farms, such as Capitella capitata, Tubificoides benedii and Socarnes erythrophthalmus. Many faunal groups were much more diverse at the reference sites than on maerl beds close to the fish farms. Small crustacea such as ostracods, isopods, tanaids and cumaceans were strongly affected by the presence of organic waste, being diverse and abundant at reference sites but impoverished around salmon cages. A particle tracking model (DEPOMOD (Cromey et al., 1998, 2002a)) was used to predict the dispersion of fish farm particulate waste away from the fish farm cages. In contrast to the field results, DEPOMOD predicted that fish farms would have minimal impacts upon the maerl benthos, by virtue of the high current regimes found at the sites. This is likely to be due to the conditions for which the DEPOMOD model was developed and validated. The DEPOMOD model has been validated using a particulate tracer study on silty mud in sheltered sea loch conditions, which are typical under most Scottish fish farms (Cromey et al., 2002b). However, it has not been validated for maerl substrata and the near bed current speeds at the three sites in this study fell outside the range for which DEPOMOD has been validated.",2006,,"{""Haskoning, U K Ltd""}",,journal,213,,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""i"", ""end_page"": ""-vi, 1--56"", ""primary_date"": ""2006-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Investigation into the impact of marine fish farm deposition on maerl beds"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Haskoning, U K Ltd',)""}"

A macroecological assessment of energetically equivalent species at 394 arid sites in North America, the Gobi Desert, and South America indicated that the number of potentially equivalent species was lower than (Gobi) or similar to (South America) that found in North America, but when segregated by trophic groups, these faunas differed markedly. North American sites included large numbers of granivorous species whereas South American sites were dominated by omnivores. The more general trophic strategy in the latter sites would be expected to facilitate compensatory responses within local faunas, suggesting either that our site is anomalous or that other factors are governing local dynamics. Further research is needed to understand the generality of compensatory dynamics within natural systems, as this mechanism has direct relevance to discussions on ecological resilience in the face of ongoing environmental change.",2015,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,96,,10.1890/14-1569.1,0012-9658,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""1702"", ""end_page"": ""1712"", ""primary_date"": ""2015-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Energetic compensation is historically contingent and not supported for small mammals in South American or Asian deserts"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

The coastal forests of Tanzania have increasingly been recognized as being of global biodiversity importance, due to high rates of species endemism. Rates of forest loss are similar to those of other tropical regions, resulting in increasing levels of threat for the biological values within the remaining forest and potentially significant source of CO sub(2) emissions. This study estimated the remaining cover and carbon stock of Tanzania's coastal forests and the CO sub(2) emissions due to forest loss between c. 1990 and c. 2007. Coastal Tanzania contained over 273 700 ha of forest in 2007.

Indian Ocean experienced the world's most deadly natural disaster ""Tsunami"" on 26th December, 2004, which on one hand is unparallel in the history considering its magnitude and devastation and on the other hand, caused an unprecedented impact on the aqua and aqua terrestrial ecosystems. One of the worst effected flora is the mangrove species that is among the richest in the world. There are places where vast pristine tracts of mangroves have been destroyed and it may pose a long-term threat for the region, not only in terms of forest and biodiversity conservation but also in terms of the ability of the ecosystem to support the livelihoods and the coastal communities. The tragedy of Tsunami invoked the rationale for conserving and sustainably managing natural ecosystems among the researchers and scientific community. The present research was carried out to make a post Tsunami evaluation of India's most ecologically fragile areas of Gulf of Mannar and South Andaman Island. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS 1C) and (IRS 1D) LISS (Linear Imaging Self Scanner)-III and Resourcesat-I LISS IV data have been effectively used to detect, assess and monitor the changes in the mangroves in the Pre and Post Tsunami period using multi-temporal optical satellite data. On-screen visual interpretation was done using FCC of the data to identify the heterogeneous patches for the preliminary classification of fieldwork. A supervised classification was performed using Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML) classifier to obtain the pre and post Tsunami land cover maps. Accuracy assessment of the classified maps was performed on pixel level using ground truth. The changes in the pre and post classification maps were performed by comparison of area basis based on different land use classes. The result highlighted the changes in the spatial extent of the mangroves and other land cover categories in the study areas as a result of Tsunami.

The analysis of coastal evolution over a period of 24 years (i.e. medium-term), was carried out using six, well temporally spaced, photogrammetric flights. Cliff top and dune toe were used as shoreline indicators to solve problems related to the use of watermark in tidal environments. Short-term littoral variations were monitored monthly by means of an electronic theodolite over a period of 2 years. The width variations of the dry beach were surveyed by always using a constant, average value for the mean sea level position derived from the numerous surveys carried out. The obtained data was representative of both seasonal and annual variations. Over medium-term, most of the littoral recorded erosion, while accretion has been recorded over recent years in the southern part. Coastal erosion was related to the impact of several storms and dune accretion was linked to the action of eastern winds. Over the short-term time frame, about the same percentage of coastal erosion and accretion was recorded. Most of the important accretion trends were observed at the central and southern parts of the littoral, the largest amount of erosion being recorded in the southern end of the littoral, in a nourished beach. All the studied beaches (except Punta Candor dunes) showed more short-term changes than medium-term ones, because of different factors, essentially the great seasonal variability of the studied beaches. The partial discrepancy between the medium and the short-term trends was related to the applied methodology, which demonstrates the problem of comparing different coastal features (dunes and cliffs on one hand, and beaches on the other) and to the implications of 2-3 years of lasting fair weather conditions that favoured beach and dune accretion, within an historical retreat tendency related to storm actions.

The purpose of this article is to present an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of biodiesel produced in Portugal from palm oil (PO) imported from Colombia, addressing the direct effects of land-use change (LUC), different fertilization schemes, and biogas management options at the extraction mill. Methods An LC inventory and model of PO biodiesel was implemented based on data collected in five Portuguese biodiesel plants and in a palm plantation and extraction mill in the Orinoquia Region of Colombia. The emissions due to carbon stock changes associated with LUC were calculated based on the Colombian oil palm area expansion from 1990 to 2010 and on historical data of vegetation cleared for planting new palm trees. Five impact categories were assessed based on ReCiPe and CML-IA methods: GHG intensity, freshwater and marine eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation, terrestrial acidification. A sensitivity analysis of alternative allocation approaches was performed. Results and discussion Palm plantation was the LC phase which contributed the most to eutrophication and acidification impacts, whereas transportation and oil extraction contributed the most to photochemical oxidation. An increase in carbon stock due to LUC associated with the expansion of Colombian oil palm was calculated (palm is a perennial crop with higher carbon stock than most previous land-uses). The choice of the fertilization scheme that leads to the lowest environmental impacts is contradictory among various categories. The use of calcium ammonium nitrate (followed by ammonium sulfate) leads to the lowest acidification and eutrophication impacts. The highest GHG intensity was calculated for calcium ammonium nitrate, while the lowest was for ammonium sulfate and poultry manure. Biogas captured and flared at the oil extraction mill instead of being released into the atmosphere had the lowest impacts in all categories (GHG intensity reduced by more than 60 % when biogas is flared instead of released). Conclusions Recommendation on the selection of the fertilization scheme depends on the environmental priority. ReCiPe and CML showed contradictory results for eutrophication and photochemical oxidation; however, uncertainty may impair strong recommendations. GHG intensity and photochemical oxidation impacts can be significantly reduced if biogas is flared instead of being released. However, more efficient biogas management should be implemented in order to reduce the impacts further.",2017,,"{""Castanheira, Erica Geraldes"",""Freire, Fausto""}",,journal,22,4,10.1007/s11367-016-1097-6,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""587"", ""end_page"": ""600"", ""primary_date"": ""2017-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Environmental life cycle assessment of biodiesel produced with palm oil from Colombia"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Castanheira, Erica Geraldes', 'Freire, Fausto')""}"

Significance tests are widely misused and misunderstood, and even when properly used, they are not very informative for most ecological data. Problems of misuse and misinterpretation include: (i) invalid logic; (ii) rote use; (iii) equating statistical significance with biological importance; (iv) regarding the P-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true; (v) regarding the P-value as a measure of effect size; and (vi) regarding the P-value as a measure of evidence. Significance tests are poorly suited for inference because they pose the wrong question. In addition, most null hypotheses in ecology are point hypotheses already known to be false, so whether they are rejected or not provides little additional understanding. Ecological data rarely fit the controlled experimental setting for which significance tests were developed. More satisfactory methods of inference assess the degree of support which data provide for hypotheses, measured in terms of information theory (model-based inference), likelihood ratios (likelihood inference) or probability (Bayesian inference). Modern statistical methods allow multiple data sets to be combined into a single likelihood framework, avoiding the loss of information that can occur when data are analyzed in separate steps.

The coastal forest of Monogaga, a protected area inhabited by a local population, is an ideal terrain for comparing the impact of local agricultural practices and the activities of Sodefor, the government agency charged with the management of this conservation area. The discourses and uses of forest resources of these two actors allow us to compare the biodiversity of forest cover categories recognized by peasant farmers and Sodefor, using the standard statistical methods for measuring biodiversity (the Shannon and Weaver index, species richness, number of special status species). For Sodefor, it is the most dense forest ecosystems (the 'black forests') and the lands that they occupy that constitute the area's natural heritage. The agency believes that these forests must be protected from all human uses, especially farming, if the forest is to be transmitted to future generations. In contrast, Wanne farmers view the old forests (kporo) as long-term fallows (t$\epsilon$t$\epsilon$klwoa) or reserves of fertile land that will be cleared when there is a need for more farmland in the future. For them, patrimony is constituted by the intergenerational transmission of a bundle of resource access and farming rights within lineages. With regard to biodiversity, a comparison of the two types of resource management practices (Sodefor and farmer) gives nuanced results. The farmers' areas are more diverse than those of Sodefor when considering the Ak{\'{e}} Assi threatened species list.

This figure contrasts with the current status of Mediterranean fisheries, where about 90{\%} of stocks are overexploited. The key question then is: can past experiences guide our current approach to reshaping governance in the Mediterranean fisheries? In our effort to answer this question, we analyzed the main attributes of selected fishing governance systems in the Early and Mid-Modern period and their evolution through time. We focussed on the Spanish Cofradias, the French Prud'homies and the Venetian Fraglie (Italy). They were characterized by the establishment of territorial user rights system of management and governed technical aspects of the fisheries, market access, and restrictions. Fishers and their communities, through their corporations/organizations, were directly involved in legislating and enforcing management policies and regulations/rules. This approach to fisheries management differs from the one introduced by the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), established in the late 1970s, which was mainly top-down. Despite the systematic efforts to reduce fishing capacity and pressure on marine resources and to impose severe technical and restrictive measures, Mediterranean fisheries are still in bad conditions. To cope with this situation the EU recently reformed the CFP establishing, among other things, a new paradigm that seeks to foster the harmonization of the decision-making process in the context of the so-called regionalization'' of fisheries management. However, this policy does not clearly establish a proper community-based approach and restricts participation to national fishers' associations in the context of the Advisory Council of the Mediterranean Sea. Without effectively linking local and regional fisheries management structures by engaging fishers and re-establishing a sense of community through providing community-based rights for fishing, this new effort will likely not succeed in achieving Mediterranean fisheries sustainability.

The conservation status of the Harbour Porpoise in The Netherlands has recently been evaluated as 'Inadequate', and the population as 'Vulnerable'. From 1900 to the early 1950s, Harbour Porpoises were abundant and widespread in coastal waters throughout the southern North Sea, including Dutch waters. The animal declined and was considered locally extinct during the 1960s-1980s. Harbour Porpoises have increased markedly in numbers in the southern North Sea in recent decades. Given changes in distribution and abundance, the conservation status of porpoises in Dutch waters is likely to require an update in the near-future. Harbour Porpoises are most abundant in relatively shallow sea areas and often forage near or at the sea bottom. Their prey spectrum includes pelagic and demersal prey species: different species of fish, cephalopods, crustaceans and polychaetes. The global abundance of the Harbour Porpoise is at least about 700,000 individuals. Within the North Sea at large, in 2005, total abundance was estimated at 230,000 individuals. A marked change in distribution was found, with considerably larger numbers of porpoises in the southern half of the North Sea in the 2005 than during an earlier census in 1994. Aerial surveys covering 50{\%} of the Dutch sector of the North Sea produced 37,000 Harbour Porpoises in Feb-April 2009 and 56,000 in Mar 2010. The current Harbour Porpoise conservation plan is a generic plan rather than area-orientated: recent research in Dutch waters failed to identify areas or regions of particular ecological significance for Harbour Porpoises for any significant length of time. Incidental capture in fishing gear (bycatch) is considered to be the most significant threat to Harbour Porpoise populations worldwide. In The Netherlands, some 150-250 animals washing ashore per annum are at least bycatch-suspect. The main type of fishing gear responsible for drowning is currently unknown, but set-nets (passive gear) are the main suspects. Bycatches occurred year-round and throughout the study area. The catch composition during which most porpoise strandings occurred varied and no set-net fisheries should be excluded a priori from an observer scheme. An onboard observer scheme should be established with priority in the winter fisheries, Dec-Mar, in the northern coastal zone (IJmuiden- Vlieland). While there is concrete evidence for avoidance behaviour of loud (explosive) underwater sounds (such as pile driving for windfarm construction, seismic exploration, underwater explosions, and naval sonar operation), there is no factual evidence for lethal damage. Adequate studies of hearing damage and death as a result of underwater sound are lacking. The distributional shift of Harbour Porpoises from more northerly parts of the North Sea into the Southern Bight may have been caused by a reduction in available prey in the north.

Siting, vessel strikes, the operational phase of windfarms, offshore mining, marine litter, chemical pollution, (chronic) marine oil pollution, natural predators, infectious disease, and parasites are all issues of concern that may in part require additional study, none of which required local (or regional, i.e. on a southern North Sea scale) mitigation measures, but rather on a higher governance level.

None of the demonstrated threats can be quantified satisfactory, given the slender factual data currently at hand. It is obvious that further research is required, before effective mitigation measures can be proposed and the precautionary approach (UNESCO 2005) could be the safest way forward. The Harbour Porpoise is legally protected in The Netherlands following international, European and national legislation, although the patchiness of current policy does not benefit an adequate protection of the Harbour Porpoise. Implementing the research and mitigation measures, as advised in this species conservation plan, serves to fulfil the requirements of The Netherlands under the relevant international legal treaties. Current research needs have been prioritised on a scale from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). Following discussions in Chapter 9, the following research needs are listed with the highest (1) priority Assessments of Harbour Porpoise population through state of the art aerial surveys, including analysis of seasonality and spatial patterns Innovative studies of the (foraging) ecology and habitat requirements of Harbour Porpoises in the Southern North Sea Prioritise an observer scheme on all fleets with passive gear to assess bycatch rates according to internationally accepted protocols Continue to assess bycatch rates in the most important fisheries (regarding bycatch) and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures A national scientific research steering group would be a suitable instrument to deal with aspects such as research needs, research quality and the evaluation of the quality and conclusions of study reports. Such a steering group should be sufficiently authoritative, but also sufficiently ""distant"" from the ongoing research. We propose that such a committee should meet and advice annually, and be composed of at least two foreign marine mammals experts, one Dutch Harbour Porpoise expert, and (vitally) one statistician. Recommended policy and mitigation measures are categorized into measures that should be applied at present and measures that depend of further knowledge from the suggested scientific research.

We quantitatively compared noise exposure to endangered southern resident killer whales before and after US federal vessel regulations were established to protect this population from disturbance by vessels and sound. We expected to see a reduction in noise exposure to this population from vessel sound propagation loss due to a doubling of the minimum viewing distance relative to a prior state law.

We collected concurrent vessel data during DTAG deployments to relate to received noise levels at the animal. Results of a linear mixed model analysis that included 10 explanatory variables in candidate models revealed that noise was best predicted by animal ID, vessel count, vessel speed category, and year. Vessel count and speed category were positive predictors of noise levels. Vessel regulations (before vs. after implementation), country, and average vessel distance were not significant predictors of noise levels, although only 1 yr of baseline data limited assessment.

The principal approach to protecting coastal property and maintaining recreational beaches in the United States today is beach nourishment. Engineering structures such as groins and seawalls have often been shown to have detrimental effects on adjacent beaches. Also, their construction and maintenance costs are quite high. Therefore,coastal communities have come to rely on a ''soft'' engineering solution - beach nourishment because it is environmentally sound, aesthetically pleasing, and so far, economically feasible. However, global warming and accelerated sea level rise will cause more rapid rates of beach loss and could make even this alternative too costly for many resort areas along the U.S. shoreline. The cost to nourish all the major recreational oceanic beaches inthe United States was estimated based on various sea level rise scenarios. The beach nourishment approach involves placing enough sand on the beach to maintain stable (nonretreating) conditions in response to rising sea level. The quantity of sand required to ''hold the line'' is evaluated under various sea level rise scenarios fi-om the baseline scenario to the I-m estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

One would therefore anticipate that there is some degree of linkage between these two compartments. Recent work has shown that respiration in the light is higher than dark respiration. Consequently, many of the methods used to determine respiration and production are biased as they require the assumption that light and dark respiration rates are equivalent. We show here that, in a coastal ecosystem, under visible light exposure, respiration in the light is related to gross production. More than 60{\%} of the variation of respiration in the light, measured at 1 to 40 $\mu$g L-1 of chlorophyll a (Chla), could be explained by the variations of gross production. Secondly, the relative contribution of bacterial respiration to community respiration in the light represented up to 79{\%} at low Chla (1 $\mu$g L-1) and was negatively correlated with Chla concentration. Although bacterial production and bacterial respiration were both enhanced in the light, bacterial respiration in the light was more stimulated than bacterial production, which resulted in a decrease in bacterial growth efficiency during light exposure. These results show that the impact of light on the functioning of the microbial loop needs to be taken into account for a better understanding of the oceanic carbon cycle. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2009,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,57,,10.1007/s00248-008-9422-7,00953628,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-59449096994%7B%5C&%7Ddoi=10.1007%7B%5C%25%7D2Fs00248-008-9422-7%7B%5C&%7DpartnerID=40%7B%5C&%7Dmd5=60f10a011ae019dcf3ec1a682346b05f"", ""pages"": ""321"", ""end_page"": ""334"", ""primary_date"": ""2009-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Respiration in the light and bacterio-phytoplankton coupling in a coastal environment"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

However, studies of habitat selection can be time consuming and expensive over broad spatial scales, and a lack of standardized monitoring targets or methods can impede the generalization of site-based studies. Our objective was to collaborate with natural resource managers to define available nesting habitat for piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) throughout their U.S. Atlantic coast distribution from Maine to North Carolina, with a goal of providing science that could inform habitat management in response to sea-level rise. We characterized a data collection and analysis approach as being effective if it provided low-cost collection of standardized habitat-selection data across the species' breeding range within 1-2 nesting seasons and accurate nesting location predictions. In the method developed, {\textgreater}30 managers and conservation practitioners from government agencies and private organizations used a smartphone application, iPlover, to collect data on landcover characteristics at piping plover nest locations and random points on 83 beaches and barrier islands in 2014 and 2015. We analyzed these data with a Bayesian network that predicted the probability a specific combination of landcover variables would be associated with a nesting site. Although we focused on a shorebird, our approach can be modified for other taxa. Results showed that the Bayesian network performed well in predicting habitat availability and confirmed predicted habitat preferences across the Atlantic coast breeding range of the piping plover. We used the Bayesian network to map areas with a high probability of containing nesting habitat on the Rockaway Peninsula in New York, USA, as an example application. Our approach facilitated the collation of evidence-based information on habitat selection from many locations and sources, which can be used in management and decision-making applications.

Thus, our research focused on evaluating the functional and structural recovery of a coastal marsh in South Louisiana to an in situ burn following a Hurricane Katrina-induced oil spill. Permanent sampling plots were set up to monitor marsh recovery in the oiled and burned areas as well as non-oiled and non-burned (reference) marshes. Plots were monitored for species composition, stem density, above- and belowground productivity, marsh resiliency, soil chemistry, soil residual oil, and organic matter decomposition. The burn removed the majority of the oil from the marsh, and structurally the marsh recovered rapidly. Plant biomass and species composition returned to control levels within 9 months; however, species richness remained somewhat lower in the oiled and burned areas compared to the reference areas. Recovery of ecological function was also rapid following the in situ burn.

All the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, except Turkey, are currently under water stress, with less than 1,000 m3/person/year of annual renewable water resources. In most countries of the Mediterranean, the vital importance of treating and safely reusing wastewater is being more and more recognized. Reused treated wastewater contributes considerably to the water budget in several countries, particularly those suffering from water scarcity. Important projects are being developed, and wastewater reclamation and reuse facilities are established following the local and/or national guidelines (Morocco, Jordan, France, Tunisia, Cyprus, etc.). However, only 75 % of the wastewater generated is treated, and only 21 % of the treated volume is formally reused. Regulations on wastewater reclamation and reuse are essential. They help to protect public health, develop cooperation among countries, increase water availability, prevent coastal pollution and enhance public policy on water resources and nature conservation. Also, they help every prospective user to be aware of existing limitations. Unifying regulations in Mediterranean countries would contribute to economic security and tourist exchanges in the region. Even within the individual countries, there is an ongoing controversy among defenders of strict water quality standards and those willing to put more emphasis on water reuse practices, suggesting less restrictive water quality standards particularly for undrinkable water uses. Expansion of treated wastewater reuse in the region is linked to a number of issues and constraints. The high cost of treatment and management of reclaimed wastewater is one of the major limitations facing the weak economy of most countries. Unclear polices, institutional conflicts and lack of regulatory frameworks constitute other important constraints that hinder implementation and proper operation of wastewater reuse projects. The manpower capacity differs from country to country, but additional training and capacity building are generally needed throughout the region. Using the treated effluent for irrigation purposes adds an economic driving force for investments in wastewater treatment. Another economic advantage of choosing agricultural irrigation as a final disposal solution for the treated effluent is that it permits low quality demands, especially with regard to nutrients removal. This chapter will address the integrated approach for reclamation and reuse of treated wastewater, the criteria and standards that should be applied for wastewater reuse in agriculture, the appropriate treatment technologies to be used for the Mediterranean areas, the viable options for reuse of wastewater, the most prominent constraints (technically, institutionally and financially), and the use of treated wastewater for agriculture within the parameters of socio-economic development in the Mediterranean region, including sustainability issues. ©2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The literature including journal articles, conference papers, government documents and news papers were reviewed to understand the influence of the established policies on communities affected by oil spills. The study establishes that the policies are laudably pronounced theoretically rather than practically. The policies lack consistency, enforcement and overlaps of mandates which is contradicting and controversial for the affected communities. In addition, the lack of clarity in compensation strategies and transparency in the process calls for a greater attention. The paper recommends that government and the oil and gas industries revisit the existing policies to in-cooperate compensation for damages due to oil spills, or enact a separate law specifically for damages from oil spillages.

The stock corresponds to two fish populations growing and moving between two fishing zones, on which they are harvested by two different fleets. The effort represents the number of fishing vessels of the two fleets which operate on the two fishing zones. The bioeconomical model is a set of four ordinary differential equations governing the stocks and the fishing efforts in the two fishing areas. Fish migration, as well as vessels displacements, between the two zones are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stocks and the changes of fleets sizes, respectively. The vessels movements between the two fishing areas are assumed to be stock dependent, i.e. the larger the stock density is in a zone the more vessels tends to remain in it. The global fish stock and the total number of vessels keep constant at the fast time scale. This property enables, via aggregation methods, the reduction of the system dimension in order to proceed to its qualitative analysis. Under some assumptions, we obtain either a stable equilibrium or a stable limit cycle which involves large cyclic variations of the total fish stock and fishing effort. Finally, we introduce a control parameter to maintain the system at a sustainable equilibrium and thus avoiding the important fluctuations founded otherwise. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This information assisted in the establishment of priorities. Mapping was replicated in 2007. After ten years of coordinated bitou bush control, comparisons indicate a significant reduction in the density of bitou bush. This includes a 17{\%} reduction in high density infestations, 44{\%} reduction in medium infestations and a 36.7{\%} reduction in light infestations. Whilst the density of the weed has been reduced, the distribution has increased by 3.5{\%} in the ten year period. This reflects reinvasion from infestations outside of the Tomaree Peninsula and illustrates the difficulties in controlling dispersal mechanisms such as birds and ocean currents. Programs are prioritized to control bitou bush at locations where significant vegetation communities, such as endangered ecological communities and threatened plant species occur. Observational data collected throughout the control program has provided important information on the ecosystem resilience of coastal vegetation communities following the control of bitou bush. Ecosystem resilience was lower in fore dune and hind dune vegetation with high density ({\textgreater}50{\%}) bitou bush infestations. These areas require revegetation to stabilize dunes and reduce secondary weed invasion. Coastal vegetation communities (such as coastal heath and forest on clay soils) demonstrated higher ecosystem resilience and were able to recover from light, medium and high density bitou bush invasion over the ten year period. This information has informed the selection of future bitou bush control sites and facilitated better site management. Despite the success of bitou bush control, secondary weed incursions, including weeds previously not widely recorded . in NSW such as Asystasia gangetica (L.) T.Anderson, Crithmum maritimum L., Eryngium maritinum L. and Tetragonia decumbens Mill, have established in sites where bitou bush infestations were treated. These sites occur in proximity to urban townships, where refuse dumping and bird dispersal remain two key vectors for secondary weeds. Dispersal by ocean currents has also been linked to at least two new secondary weed incursions. Some of these secondary weeds are more difficult and expensive to control than bitou bush, thus increasing original follow-up cost predictions. Regardless, once a program has commenced, the commitment to continue follow-up of all weed species is integral. This includes continuing to support community engagement as a component of the programs. Active community support has contributed greatly to the success of holistic weed control at a number of sites. Ignoring boundaries and developing priorities across land tenure has increased the success of coordinated bitou bush (and other weed) control. Undertaking programs cooperatively is the most effective way to deal with andscape weed invasion. This program is an example of what can be achieved when different land managers and community groups can develop and implement strategies together and forge a commitment for consistent follow-up. Given the continual dispersal of bitou bush (and other weeds) and the constant risk of reinvasion, long-term control will continue to be an ongoing part of managing coastal vegetation communities on the Tomaree Peninsula.",2008,,{NA},{NA},NA,23,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-40949144178%7B%5C&%7DpartnerID=40%7B%5C&%7Dmd5=6c12e688d1f13314a564dfdd1c97d83d"", ""primary_date"": ""2008-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Coordinated regeneration programs in coastal vegetation on the Tomaree Peninsula - A decade of bitou bush control"", ""place_published"": ""Parks and Wildlife Group, Department of Environment and Climate Change, Locked Bag 99, Nelson Bay, NSW 2317, Australia Port Stephens Council, PO Box 2324, Raymond Terrace, NSW 2324, Australia"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

In addition, wetlands can buffer pollutions, absorb floods and recharge aquifers. Yemen has been identified as hosting globally important biodiversity, thanks to its situation at the crossroads between the Afrotropical, Oriental and Palearctic regions. This biodiversity is particularly rich in coastal wetlands, given that the coastline of Yemen is over 2500 km long and overlapping three different seas with different characteristics that is: The Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea. Coastal wetlands are continuously lost under pressure of several problems such as human activities, lack of data and climate change. This means that urgent description of these causes is needed to conserve wetland biodiversity. The main objective of this research is to give to the Yemeni government and other stakeholders baseline information to initiate a process of protection coastal wetlands.

The rockfish assemblage was dominated by small and short-lived species not typically targeted by recreational or commercial fishing (i.e. shortbelly S. jordani and squarespot S. hopkinsi rockfishes), but also contained moderate abundances of a few larger, targeted species (bank S. rufus and bocaccio S. paucispinis rockfishes). Spawning locations of many species were affected by environmental variability, as abundances of young (0 to 2 d old), targeted larvae were mainly found offshore in the cool, low primary production waters that also were relatively shallow and contained hard substrate. In contrast, untargeted species were more widespread and correlated positively only with hard substrate. Hotspots of species richness and targeted species were high within a large managed region, the Cowcod Conservation Area, indicating that it is effectively protecting important rockfish spawning habitat.

At reference sites, amphipods or polychaetes numerically dominated, while crabs dominated the biomass. There were significant temporal changes in abundance, which were attributable to either change in amphipod or polychaete abundance. The biomass, however, fluctuated only slightly over time. Three capped pits (CPA, CPB, CPC) all started with low biomass and abundance, and showed increase in both parameters over time. The increase in abundance ranged only from 1.0 to 2.3 times, whereas the increase in biomass ranged from 5.2 to 50.0 times. The final abundance and biomass at CPB were comparable to those at the reference sites. CPA and CPC had lower abundance than the reference sites, but the biomass was >15 times higher than the biomass at the reference sites. Small polychaetes numerically dominated all the three capped pits (58-79%), but the relative contribution of taxa to total biomass varied with the pits: molluscs dominated CPA (98%) and CPC (83%), whereas polychaetes (30%), crustaceans (27%), and molluscs (21%) dominated CPB. Our results indicate that benthos appear to have recolonized the capped pits; and there seem to be two recolonization patterns on the basis of biomass, one characterized by the dominance by molluscs and the other by the dominance by crustaceans and molluscs.

Application to the marine park of the Blue Coast,,"The overexploitation of fishery resources has led to a major fisheries crisis. In this context, artisanal fisheries, and in particular small-scale coastal fisheries, appear as relevant alternatives for a sustainable use of coastal resources. But the diversity of fishing gears and targeted species diversity make it difficult to assess this important component of the commercial fishery. Hence, the activity of small-scale artisanal fishing remains poorly known in the Mediterranean Sea and few studies focus on an assessment of this activity at the scale of a Marine Protected Area (MPA). MPAs are yet more and more used as management tools for these fisheries, as protection effects and targeted access regulations may benefit to commercial fishers. As many MPAs are going to be established in the short term, it seems necessary for managers and for scientists, to have indicators to monitor the artisanal small-scale coastal fishing activity within an MPA, and to estimate the effects of MPA management on this activity. A field protocol was defined and implemented between July 2009 and June 2010 within the Parc Marin de la Cote Bleue (PMCB), a French Mediterranean MPA including two marine reserves of different age and size. The collected data allowed identifying seven main metiers within the PMCB, and characterizing them by group of target species, type of gear, fishing grounds and fishing periods. Fishing effort and catch were estimated. In the Cote Bleue area, 3 512 fishing trips and 4 645 fishing operations were performed by 30 active boats during the studied period, for a total of 9 500 km of immersed nets. Overall, about 140 of catches were landed in the 6 harbours of the PMCB.Original Abstract: La surexploitation des ressources halieutiques a conduit a une crise majeure du secteur de la peche professionnelle. Dans ce contexte, les pecheries artisanales, et notamment les pecheries aux petits metiers cotiers, apparaissent comme des modes d'exploitation potentiellement durables des ressources cotieres. La diversite des engins utilises et des especes ciblees rend neanmoins complexe le suivi de cette composante importante de la peche professionnelle. L'activite de peche artisanale reste ainsi tres peu evaluee en Mediterranee, et notamment a l'echelle d'une Aire Marine Protegee (AMP). Les AMP sont pourtant de plus en plus utilisees comme des outils de gestion de ces pecheries, les effets des differentes mesures de gestion mises en place etant a meme de beneficier aux pecheurs professionnels. A l'heure ou le nombre d'AMP se multiplie, il apparait alors necessaire pour les gestionnaires comme pour les scientifiques de disposer d'indicateurs permettant de suivre l'activite de peche professionnelle sur le territoire d'une AMP, et d'evaluer les effets de la gestion sur cette activite.

Water reclamation and reuse has become an attractive option for conserving and extending available water sources. The decentralized approach to domestic WW treatment benefits from the advantages of source separation, which makes available simple small-scale systems and on-site reuse, which can be constructed on a short time schedule and occasionally upgraded with new technological developments. In this study we perform a Life Cycle Assessment to compare between the environmental impacts of four alternatives for a hypothetical city's water-wastewater service system. The baseline alternative is the most common, centralized approach for WW treatment, in which WW is conveyed to and treated in a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and is then discharged to a stream. The three alternatives represent different scales of distribution of the WW treatment phase, along with urban irrigation and domestic non-potable water reuse (toilet flushing). The first alternative includes centralized treatment at a WWTP, with part of the reclaimed WW (RWW) supplied back to the urban consumers. The second and third alternatives implement de-centralized greywater (GW) treatment with local reuse, one at cluster level (320 households) and one at building level (40 households). Life cycle impact assessment results show a consistent disadvantage of the prevailing centralized approach under local conditions in Israel, where seawater desalination is the marginal source of water supply. The alternative of source separation and GW reuse at cluster level seems to be the most preferable one, though its environmental performance is only slightly better than GW reuse at building level. Centralized WW treatment with urban reuse of WWTP effluents is not advantageous over decentralized treatment of GW because the supply of RWW back to consumers is very costly in materials and energy. Electricity is a major driver of the impacts in most categories, pertaining mostly to potable water production and supply. Infrastructure was found to have a notable effect on metal depletion, human toxicity and freshwater and marine ecotoxicity. Sensitivity to major model parameters was analyzed. A shift to a larger share of renewable energy sources in the electricity mix results in a dramatic improvement in most impact categories. Switching to a mix of water sources, rather than the marginal source, leads to a significant reduction in most impacts. It is concluded that under the conditions tested, a decentralized approach to urban wastewater management is environmentally preferable to the common centralized system. It is worth exploring such options under different conditions as well, in cases which new urban infrastructure is planned or replacement of old infrastructure is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They sustain abundant marine life as well as commercial and artisanal fisheries, and help protect shorelines from coastal erosion. Additionally, seagrass meadows are a globally significant sink for carbon and represent a key ecosystem for combating climate change. However, seagrass habitats are suffering rapid global decline. Despite recognition of the importance of ""Blue Carbon,"" no functioning seagrass restoration or conservation projects supported by carbon finance currently operate, and the policies and frameworks to achieve this have not been developed. Yet, seagrass ecosystems could play a central role in addressing important international research questions regarding the natural mechanisms through which the ocean and the seabed can mitigate climate change, and how ecosystem structure links to service provision. The relative inattention that seagrass ecosystems have received represents both a serious oversight and a major missed opportunity. In this paper we review the prospects of further inclusion of seagrass ecosystems in climate policy frameworks, with a particular focus on carbon storage and sequestration, as well as the potential for developing payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes that are complementary to carbon management. Prospects for the inclusion of seagrass Blue Carbon in regulatory compliance markets are currently limited; yet despite the risks the voluntary carbon sector offers the most immediately attractive avenue for the development of carbon credits. Given the array of ecosystem services seagrass ecosystems provide the most viable route to combat climate change, ensure seagrass conservation and improve livelihoods may be to complement any carbon payments with seagrass PES schemes based on the provision of additional ecosystem services.",2015,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,2,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2015.00032,NA,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""https://login.proxy.lib.duke.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1722171790?accountid=10598 http://pm6mt7vg3j.search.serialssolutions.com/directLink?%7B%5C&%7Datitle=Harnessing+the+climate+mitigation%7B%5C%25%7D2C+conservation+and+poverty+al"", ""pages"": ""1"", ""end_page"": ""22"", ""primary_date"": ""2015-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Harnessing the climate mitigation, conservation and poverty alleviation potential of seagrasses: prospects for developing blue carbon initiatives and payment for ecosystem service programmes"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

The habitat shift is often accompanied by feeding shifts and metamorphosis from larval to juvenile phases. Density-dependent settlement, growth and mortality are often the major factors controlling recruitment success of this phase. Habitat use also becomes more pronounced after settlement. The role of habitat-mediated post-settlement mortality is elucidated by focusing on the early life history of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) in the north-west Atlantic. In these species, settlement can occur over all bottom types, but habitat-specific differences in post-settlement mortality rates combined with size and priority at settlement effects on growth and survival determine recruitment and eventual year-class strength. These results and those from other temperate marine fish species along with work on tropical reef species emphasize the generality of habitat-based density-dependent mortality during the transition phase and its potential for population regulation. These results have implications for fisheries management and can be used to outline a procedure to assist managers in identifying and managing essential transitional habitats including the potential role of marine protected areas in habitat conservation.

The world's largest ray, the oceanic manta (Manta birostris) is poorly studied and threatened globally by targeted fisheries and incidental capture. Very little information is available on the natural history, ecology and behavior of the species, complicating management efforts. This study provides the first data on the diving behavior of the species based on data returned from six tagged individuals, and an opportunistic observation from a submersible of a manta foraging at depth. Pop-off archival satellite tags deployed on mantas at the Revillagigedo Archipelago, Mexico recorded seasonal shifts in diving behavior, likely related to changes in the location and availability of zooplankton prey. Across seasons, mantas spent a large proportion of their time centered around the upper limit of the thermocline, where zooplankton often aggregate. Tag data reveal a gradual activity shift from surface waters to 100-150 m across the tagging period, possibly indicating a change in foraging behavior from targeting surface-associated zoo plankton to vertical migrators. The depth ranges accessed by mantas in this study carry variable bycatch risks from different fishing gear types. Consequently, region-specific data on diving behavior can help inform local management strategies that reduce or mitigate bycatch of this vulnerable species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Maximum number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 14, and observed heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.143 to 0.795 (0.539 +/- 0.087, mean +/- SE). Pairwise region estimates of F-ST, R-ST and D-est were very low ({\textless}0.040) and not significant in all comparisons. Bayesian clustering analysis also suggested homogeneity in S. latus across all regions. The Almeria-Oran front, an important biogeographic boundary between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins, was not found to have a significant impact on the genetic structuring of S. laws. Overall, all of our analyses of genetic differentiation and migration suggested panmixia in S. laws across its distributional range. Such pattern is likely to result from its high fecundity and long-lived pelagic larva, which can promote high levels of connectivity between geographically distant populations.

Yet, despite their seasonal proximity to urbanized areas in this region, there is limited information on patterns of wintering sea duck habitat use. It is difficult to gather information on sea ducks because of the relative inaccessibility of their offshore locations, their high degree of mobility, and their aggregated distributions. To characterize environmental conditions that affect wintering distributions, as well as their geographic ranges, we analyzed count data on five species of sea ducks (black scoters Melanitta nigra americana, surf scoters M. perspicillata, white-winged scoters M. fusca, common eiders Somateria mollissima, and long-tailed ducks Clangula hyemalis) that were collected during the Atlantic Flyway Sea Duck Survey for ten years starting in the early 1990s. We modeled count data for each species within ten-nautical-mile linear survey segments using a zero-inflated negative binomial model that included four local-scale habitat covariates (sea surface temperature, mean bottom depth, maximum bottom slope, and a variable to indicate if the segment was in a bay or not), one broad-scale covariate (the North Atlantic Oscillation), and a temporal correlation component. Our results indicate that species distributions have strong latitudinal gradients and consistency in local habitat use. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental covariate that had a significant (but variable) effect on the expected count for all five species, suggesting that broad-scale climatic conditions may be directly or indirectly important to the distributions of wintering sea ducks. Our results provide critical information on species-habitat associations, elucidate the complicated relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation, sea surface temperature, and local sea duck abundances, and should be useful in assessing the impacts of climate change on seabirds. {\textcopyright} US Government 2010.",2010,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,163,,10.1007/s00442-010-1622-4,00298549,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954538413%7B%5C&%7Ddoi=10.1007%7B%5C%25%7D2Fs00442-010-1622-4%7B%5C&%7DpartnerID=40%7B%5C&%7Dmd5=6f21880b14c8f04899e4eb1aa62a82b5"", ""pages"": ""893"", ""end_page"": ""902"", ""primary_date"": ""2010-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Distribution patterns of wintering sea ducks in relation to the North Atlantic Oscillation and local environmental characteristics"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Our analyses indicated that swath width would have little or no effect on the probability that at least one fish school would be encountered. In typical coastal waters off California (attenuation coefficient=0.1/m), about half of the schools were detected by the lidar during the day and about 64{\%} during the night. A greater proportion of schools were detected during the night because anchovy have a shallow vertical distribution, whereas in the day, schools may extend down to 155 m; schools below about 40 m depth were not detectable to the laser. Although schools tended to be more diffuse during the night than during the day, even the very diffuse schools of anchovy (0.5 fish/m(3)) were detectable at night throughout the upper 20 m of the water column with a lidar. With a substantial increase in instrument and survey costs, it would be possible to increase the equivalent laser-pulsed power by a factor of 10 over that of the ""off-the-shelf system,"" as used in our model. Such a change would increase the maximum detection depth of the lidar system by about 10 m but would have a negligible effect on the probability of detecting schools during the day owing to the skewed vertical distribution of anchovy schools. More effective approaches for improving the accuracy and precision of potential lidar surveys for fisheries would be to improve school detection algorithms and to develop a lidar survey model based on line transect theory to obtain an unbiased estimate of abundance. To produce an accurate reconstruction of the average vertical distribution of schools for a particular season and region, a synthesis of acoustic and lidar surveys of school distribution is required.",2000,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,98,,NA,0090-0656,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""264"", ""end_page"": ""282"", ""primary_date"": ""2000-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Modeling statistical performance of an airborne lidar survey system for anchovy"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

The objective of this project was to identify the factors that influence the annual growth patterns of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) based on an analysis of otolith increments. We applied linear mixed models to develop a 74-year long chronology that reflects the inter-annual variations in flounder growth rates using otolith samples collected from 1957 to 2016 in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be highly vulnerable to global climate change. By analyzing the widths of otolith increments we revealed the existence of common environmental factors that influence fish growth. Using a mixed modeling framework, we incorporated a recent method to identify the optimal time window for climatic factors and showed that the most significant effect of the mean Baltic Sea index occurs during August December, while mean sea surface temperature is most significant from April June.

Under conditions of +10,000 PPM CO2 in seawater (pH 6.8), the egg production rates of copepods decreased significantly.

Furthermore, the size of pluteus larvae decreased with increasing CO2 concentration and malformed skeletogenesis was observed in both larvae.

We investigated how a predator-free black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis Merriam, 1898) population introduced to the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada) responded to short-term hunting for fear. We conducted a hunt that minimized killing and maximized scaring on an island where some deer were marked. Between control and hunted sites, we compared deer use of bait stations and of shoreline areas (i.e., an open and risky area that provided marine subsidies). We also compared the browsing pressure and growth of two grasses and two shrubs. Hunting for fear had no effect on the overall use of bait stations and shorelines. However, in the area exposed to hunting, unmarked deer, which were assumed to be less tolerant of human disturbance, avoided bait stations at the outset of hunting.

The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, tends honeydew-excreting homopterans and can disrupt the activity of their natural enemies. This mutualism is often cited for increases in homopteran densities; however, the ant's impact on natural enemies may be only one of several effects of ant tending that alters insect densities. To test for the variable impacts of ants, mealybug and natural enemy densities were monitored on ant-tended and ant-excluded vines in two California vineyard regions. 2. Ant tending increased densities of the obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni, and lowered densities of its encyrtid parasitoids Pseudaphycus flavidulus and Leptomastix epona. Differences in parasitoid recovery rates suggest that P. flavidulus was better able to forage on ant-tended vines than L. epona. 3. Densities of a coccinellid predator, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, were higher on ant-tended vines, where there were more mealybugs. Together with behavioural observations, the results showed that this predator can forage in patches of ant-tended mealybugs, and that it effectively mimics mealybugs to avoid disturbance by ants. 4. Ant tending increased densities of the grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus, by increasing the number of surviving first-instar mealybugs. Parasitoids were nearly absent from the vineyard infested with P. maritimus. Therefore, ants improved either mealybug habitat or fitness. 5. There was no difference in mealybug distribution or seasonal development patterns on ant-tended and ant-excluded vines, indicating that ants did not move mealybugs to better feeding locations or create a spatial refuge from natural enemies. 6. Results showed that while Argentine ants were clearly associated with increased mealybug densities, it is not a simple matter of disrupting natural enemies. Instead, ant tending includes benefits independent of the effect on natural enemies. Moreover, the effects on different natural enemy species varied, as some species thrive in the presence of ants.",2007,,"{""Cooper, Monica L"",""Daane, Kent M"",""Fallon, Julie"",""Sime, Karen R""}",,journal,32,6,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00910.x,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""583"", ""end_page"": ""596"", ""primary_date"": ""2007-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Impacts of Argentine ants on mealybugs and their natural enemies in California's coastal vineyards"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Cooper, Monica L', 'Daane, Kent M', 'Fallon, Julie', 'Sime, Karen R')""}"

Given the pace and extent of predator loss, an understanding of these processes is important. Two sets of adjacent coral reef systems off north-western Australia have similar biological, physical and environmental conditions, but one of the reef systems has been exposed to nearly exclusive commercial fishing of sharks. Across reefs where sharks have been depleted, prey fishes had significantly smaller caudal fins and eyes compared to the reefs with intact shark populations (up to 40 and 46{\%} relative difference in standardized means). These patterns were consistent across 7 teleost prey species (N = 611 individuals) that vary in behavior, diet and trophic guild. We hypothesize that these morphological patterns were primarily driven by differences in shark predation. Morphological differences were not consistent with plausible alternative explanations (habitat complexity, temperature, light, current, food availability, prey targets, competition) as primary drivers. These results provide field evidence of morphological changes in prey potentially due to predator depletions consistent with ecological predictions; specifically, predator loss caused a reduction in the size of prey morphological traits associated with predator detection and evasion. While our analysis cannot differentiate between rapid evolutionary change versus morphological plasticity due to shark depletions, either possible outcome would indicate that predator removals may have profound effects on body shapes of prey communities.

Artisanal (small scale) fisheries extend from the coast to 40 m while industrial (commercial scale) fisheries operate beyond 40 m depth. The coastal fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex multi-species resource. There are 18 demersal and pelagic species, seven species of larger pelagic and 10 shrimp species that are commercially important among the fishes exploited. In 1996 - 97, total fish production reached 1.3 million t with 75{\%} from capture fisheries (0.9 million t) and 25{\%} from aquaculture (0.4 million t). Artisanal fishing operations dominated the marine fisheries, contributing 82{\%} of the total fish production. Information on the gross national product (GNP) and domestic product (GDP) showed that the share of agriculture has been declining over the years. The national income accounting procedure in Bangladesh divides the agriculture sector into crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries. Fisheries contribute to economic development of the country in four ways: (a) helping to achieve high growth rates by creating the necessary value-added; (b) providing employment to a large number of people; (c) adding a large volume of valuable foreign exchange; and (d) providing a cheap source of essential food to lower income people. In 1997 - 98, GNP, GDP and value-added contributions at current prices by the fisheries sector amounted to US{\$}35716 mil, US{\$}34062 mil and US{\$}1808 mil, respectively. Of the total export value of US{\$}1217 mil, 8.5{\%} (US{\$}104 mil) came from fish and fish products. In terms of food consumption, fish ranks third as the most important food item with a mean per capita consumption of 8.36 kg-year super(-1). There are three major fishing fleets in Bangladesh namely, the trawlers, the mechanized boats and the non-mechanized boats. In 1972 - 73, there were 10 trawlers and 200 mechanized boats operating in the fishing grounds of Bangladesh. This expanded to 54 trawlers, 3317 mechanized boats and 14 014 non-mechanized boats in 1996 - 97. Trawlers were divided into 41 shrimp and 13 fish units while mechanized boats included gillnet, set bag net and long-line gear. Non-mechanized boats are also used for gillnet fishing, set bag net fishing, long-line fishing, trammel net fishing and other gear. The Schaefer and Fox Models were used to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the fisheries of Bangladesh. Results of these bioeconomic models show that MSY is estimated to be 4029 t at MSY effort of 9317 standard fishing days (SFD) using Schaefer's Model. MSY reached 4136 t at MSY effort of 11822 SFD using Fox's Model. The current catch of 2444 t at an effort of 7491 SFD indicates over-fishing. If this situation continues, the fishery resources will diminish with time. Precautionary measures should be adopted by the Government to minimize if not totally prevent over-exploitation of the fishery resource in the Bay of Bengal. The Government should enact laws and ensure their enforcement. The present number of large trawlers and boat owners should not be allowed to increase. The trawlers and large boat operators should avoid intrusion into near-shore areas and reduce discards/by-catch problems. Artisanal fishers should abandon destructive fishing gear like estuarine set bag net (ESBN), push nets and current jall that kill small fish.

The study investigates the community's temporal and spatial fluctuation and its profile of vertical distribution in sandy habitats when compared to the coral reef habitats of the gulf. Sampling was carried out through four cruises during spring (March 2008), summer (June 2008), autumn (September 2008) and winter (December 2008). Nutrient concentrations were found to be very low. The copepod community of the Gulf of Aqaba was found to be dominated by 81 species.

Seasonal changes in the vertical and horizontal distribution of planktonic copepods are described for a 100 m water column in the Gulf of Aqaba, covering spring, summer, autumn and winter. Four different distribution patterns exemplified by planktonic copepods are highlighted: (1) a horizontal variance, demonstrating an inverse distribution pattern between sandy and coral reef habitats, in which the population density was greater offshore at the coral reef stations, while it was greater inshore at the sandy stations; (2) a vertical distribution pattern in which approximately 50{\%} of the population occurred in the upper 25 m of the water column of the gulf, while less than 10{\%} occurred between the depths of 75 and 100 m; (3) a seasonal distribution pattern in which the copepods exhibited considerable fluctuation in their occurrence and abundance, with a peak in winter (December) and minimum abundance values during summer (September); (4) a site distribution patterns with a peak in population density at the northern stations and a decline southwards. These patterns of copepod distribution in the Gulf of Aqaba suggested a strong influence from local endemic geographic and hydrographic differences, the predation impact of local inhabitants and the policy of ""better dead than unfed"", but no response to water nutrient levels.

Field visits, interviews, focus group discussions and a literature survey allowed us to map socioeconomic and environmental factors important to the fisheries, including conflicts and tensions between stakeholders. Federal, state, and municipal governments, industries, farmers, hydroelectric companies, and urban and rural populations all have a stake in river use. Traditional fishers are the most disadvantaged of these stakeholders. With declining fish populations, most of the fishing communities surveyed are now poor, socially excluded, and with few alternative livelihood options. The stakeholders involved in access and use conflicts are artisanal fishers, professional fishers, sport fishers, farmers, enforcement and regulatory agencies, and hydroelectric companies. Traditional fishers have close ties to the river and its environment and they are usually not invited to contribute to resource management decisions.

Conservation and management, on the other hand, focus on populations. The field of conservation physiology addresses the question of how abiotic drivers of physiological responses at the level of the individual alter requirements for successful conservation and management of populations. To achieve this, impacts of physiological effects at the individual level need to be scaled to impacts on population dynamics, which requires consideration of ecology. Successfully realizing the potential of conservation physiology requires interdisciplinary studies incorporating physiology and ecology, and requires that a constructive dialogue develops between these traditionally disparate fields. To encourage this dialogue, we consider the increasingly explicit incorporation of physiology into ecological models applied to marine fish conservation and management. Conservation physiology is further challenged as the physiology of an individual revealed under laboratory conditions is unlikely to reflect realized responses to the complex variable stressors to which it is exposed in the wild. Telemetry technology offers the capability to record an animal's behaviour while simultaneously recording environmental variables to which it is exposed.

One activity associated with declines in freshwater fish populations is water resource development, including dams, weirs, and hydropower facilities. Fish passing through irrigation and hydro infrastructures during downstream migration experience a rapid decrease in pressure, which can lead to injuries (barotrauma) that contribute to mortality. There is renewed initiative to expand hydropower and irrigation infrastructure to improve water security and increase low-carbon energy generation. The impact of barotrauma on fish must be understood and mitigated to ensure that development is sustainable for fisheries.

Climate change will alter the physico-chemical environment that reefs currently occupy, leaving only limited regions that are conducive to reef habitation. Identifying these regions early may aid conservation efforts and inform decisions to transplant particular coral species or groups. Here a species distribution model (Maxent) is used to describe habitat suitable for coral reef growth. Two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Earth System Model were used with Maxent to determine environmental suitability for corals (order Scleractinia). Environmental input variables best at representing the limits of suitable reef growth regions were isolated using a principal component analysis. Climate-driven changes in suitable habitat depend strongly on the unique region of reefs used to train Maxent. Increased global habitat loss was predicted in both climate projections through the 21st century. A maximum habitat loss of 43{\%} by 2100 was predicted in RCP4.5 and 82{\%} in RCP8.5. When the model is trained solely with environmental data from the Caribbean/Atlantic, 83{\%} of global habitat was lost by 2100 for RCP4.5 and 88{\%} was lost for RCP8.5. Similarly, global runs trained only with Pacific Ocean reefs estimated that 60{\%} of suitable habitat would be lost by 2100 in RCP4.5 and 90{\%} in RCP8.5. When Maxent was trained solely with Indian Ocean reefs, suitable habitat worldwide increased by 38{\%} in RCP4.5 by 2100 and 28{\%} in RCP8.5 by 2050. Global habitat loss by 2100 was just 10{\%} for RCP8.5. This projection suggests that shallow tropical sites in the Indian Ocean basin experience conditions today that are most similar to future projections of worldwide conditions. Indian Ocean reefs may thus be ideal candidate regions from which to select the best strands of coral for potential re-seeding efforts.",2013,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,8,,10.1371/journal.pone.0082404,1932-6203,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""primary_date"": ""2013-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Coral Reef Habitat Response to Climate Change Scenarios"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Rock habitats at depths to 300 m were identified by using bathymetric and side-scan sonar imaging, verified by visual observations from a manned submersible, mapped and quantified. Species composition, abundance, size, and habitat specificity of fishes were determined by using a video camera and parallel laser system along transects made by a submersible. We counted 6208 nonschooling fishes representing at least 52 species from 83 10-min strip transects that covered an estimated 33,754 m super(2). Rockfishes represented 77{\%} of the total number of individuals, and included a minimum of 24 species. Six distinct habitat guilds of fishes were manifest from habitat-based clustering analysis: small species were associated with mud and cobble substrata of low relief, and larger species of rockfishes were associated with high-relief structures such as vertical rock walls, ridges, and boulder fields. There was remarkable concordance between some of the guilds identified in Soquel Canyon and the results of other habitat-specific assessments of fishes along the west coast of the United States from central California to Alaska. These generalities are valuable in predicting community structure and evaluating changes to that structure, as well as in applying small-scale species-habitat relationships to broader-scale fishery resource surveys. Additionally, establishment of these groups is critical when incorporating the concept of essential fish habitat (EFH), and negative impacts to it, into the management of fisheries in relatively deep water, as required by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. High numbers of large rockfishes (e.g. Sebastes chlorostictus, S. levis, S. rosenbblatti, and S. ruberrimus) were locally associated with rock ledges, caves, and overhangs at sites having little or no evidence of fishing activity. Abundance and size of several species were lower at fished than at unfished sites. We suggest that rock outcrops of high relief interspersed with mud in deep water of narrow submarine canyons are less accessible to fishing activities and thereby can provide natural refuge for economically important fishes, as exemplified in Soquel Canyon.",2000,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,98,,NA,None,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""https://login.proxy.lib.duke.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/17604730?accountid=10598 http://pm6mt7vg3j.search.serialssolutions.com/directLink?%257B%255C&%257Datitle=Habitat+associations+of+deep-water+rockfishes+in+a+submarine+canyon%257B%255C%2525%25"", ""pages"": ""625"", ""end_page"": ""641"", ""primary_date"": ""2000-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Habitat associations of deep-water rockfishes in a submarine canyon: an example of a natural refuge"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Local parasitic fauna is characterized by a high number of fresh water parasite species (14 of 72 fully identified species) not yet known from other countries and possibly endemic to western Asia or even to water basins of Israel and Syria. Ethiopian elements are probably well represented in local waters, infesting fish of African origin. The palearctic element is poorly represented in local waters mainly by non-specific parasite species infesting endemic or west Asiatic fish species, but is secondarily enriched by introduced parasites of the European carp. The oriental element is apparently absent from local waters, although a large number of local cyprinids are of genera of oriental origin. The local population of the paleotropic species Orientocreatium batranchoides is apparently a descendant of the African population of this species. Many species of marine origin were found in fishes of the coastal plain. A relict population of Aphanius dispar (Ruppel) in springs south of the Dead Sea was infested with same monogenetic trematode, which infests the coastal plain population of these fishes in spite of their prolonged isolation. The distribution of parasitic species, highly specific to the host species in local waters, in most cases, correspond to that of their hosts, and they show similar ecological accomodation to that of their host (mainly as to salinity). Non-specific parasites were widely distributed in all inland waters, but in many cases were limited to fresh water basins only. Several species of parasites were endemic to the Lake of Galilee. The rate of infestation (mainly with ectoparasites) was high in the Lake of Galilee and in small water reservoirs as well as in fish ponds, while fishes in swiftly flowing streams were found to be either free of infestation or only slightly infested. Changes in the rate of infestation which could be correlated with age of the fishes were characteristic for fish which at different ages live in different biotopes or which as juveniles live in separate schools. Thus, infestation in some fish species increased or diminished with their age. Changes in the parasite fauna were significant mainly in mullets, which migrate to the sea for spawning and in some Lake of Galilee fishes.

As elsewhere in Florida, beachfront communities can have a tremendous impact on the success or failure of sea turtle nesting. To increase awareness, interest and protection of sea turtles, a new program NESTS-Neighbors Ensuring Sea Turtle Survival, was developed to work with coastal homeowners associations and individual homeowners living on Florida's barrier islands. Program partners include Walt Disney World, The Ocean Conservancy, Caribbean Conservation Corporation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Friends of the Carr Refuge, Brevard Zoo, Sea Turtle Preservation Society and the Florida Park Service. The concept of NESTS is to engage individuals living in coastal areas in simple activities that will have a direct benefit to helping the survival of sea turtles and protecting their nesting habitat. Through three levels of certification (Partner, Guardian and Champion) participants have the opportunity to become directly involved, as well as engaging others in their community, through completing activities that protect sea turtles and their habitat. The first year of our program has been successful and generated considerable interest and community support.

Here we examined the influence of microhabitats on the distribution and survival of the exploited limpet Patella candei on natural shores before determining the effect of introducing such habitats to an artificial seawall. On natural shores individuals were associated with pits (a natural feature of volcanic rocky shores). Animals inhabiting pits showed reduced mortality and were smaller than those on open rock. Microhabitat utilisation was similar over the vertical range of distribution of A candei. Following observation of natural patterns, we applied this knowledge by experimentally drilling pits at varying densities and sizes in a seawall that had been constructed with simple topographical complexity. Overall, the number of animals increased in areas with experimentally increased microhabitat area. There was evidence that this was the result of immigration (larger animals) but also of increased recruitment.

Effects of sewage discharges on estuarine invertebrates and birds,,"Human communities often discharge wastewaters into estuaries, influencing their organic and pollutant loading, benthic community and trophic structure. The implementation of the Water Framework Directive has encouraged the treatment of wastewater discharges across European estuaries, but the implications for invertebrate and waterbird communities are poorly understood. We explore the effects of untreated sewage discharges on the distribution and abundance of foraging black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa and their main benthic prey (bivalves and polychaetes) on the Tejo estuary in Portugal, a major European Special Protection Area with ongoing wastewater improvements. Patches of mudflat in close proximity to sewage streams (<30 m) can support polychaete densities and biomass that are an order of magnitude higher than more distant sites (>70 m), and godwits foraging in these areas can attain the highest intake rates recorded for the estuary. However, high intake rates can also be attained on bivalve prey, and bivalve biomass and density increase slightly with distance from sewage streams. As the organic input from sewage outfalls influences invertebrate abundance and godwit foraging rates over relatively small areas, the ongoing implementation of a sewage treatment network on the Tejo estuary seems likely to have only a limited impact on the wintering godwit population. The localized effect of untreated sewage discharges on benthic communities suggests that the implications for predatory birds are relatively minor where alternative prey are available, but may be more severe in locations with more depauperate, polychaete-dominated invertebrate communities.",2012,,"{""Alves, J A"",""Gill, J A"",""Sutherland, W J""}",,journal,15,1,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2011.00485.x,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""44"", ""end_page"": ""52"", ""primary_date"": ""2012-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Will improving wastewater treatment impact shorebirds?

Unauthorised public access to wetland sanctuaries can lead to a number of management problems, such as increasing disturbance to migratory shorebirds. We investigate unauthorised human use of a coastal urban wetland located in Melbourne, Australia, and use current results to predict future patterns of visitation under different management and urban development scenarios. Despite being officially closed to the public, 20.8{\%} of the 574 ha wetland experienced human intrusions during the sampling period. These were most frequent in the section which directly abuts residential development where over 50{\%} of the wetland experienced intrusions. The most frequently observed activities were walking (4.8 +/- 4.9 intrusions per observation day), dog walking (8.5 +/- 4.5), cycling (3.0 +/- 1.8) and motorised trail bike riding (2.5 +/- 1.0). There were significant negative relationships between the occurrence of intrusions and distance from the wetland boundary and access points. Walkers and dog walkers were likely to intrude more deeply into the wetlands than other users. We predict that once residential development is completed around the entire perimeter of the wetland that 48{\%} of the total area will be subject to intrusions. This will increase to 58.8{\%} if internal management tracks are opened for public use.

This may be particularly true for ectotherms, where behaviour and physiology (e.g. digestion, responsiveness and activity patterns) are strongly influenced by thermal conditions of microhabitat retreat sites. Retreat sites selected by south-west carpet pythons (Morelia spilota imbricata) were identified through radiotracking 46 pythons over 3 years. Tree hollows appear to be a very important resource for pythons: 61{\%} (22 of 36 individuals tracked over winter) used tree hollows as retreat sites (56{\%} of all observations in winter), and remained in hollows for an average of 124 +/- 49 (range 34 to 210) days. If pythons did not use tree hollows over winter, they found refuge in one of four alternative microhabitats: low vegetation cover (26{\%} of winter observations), ground cover (10{\%}), on tree branches (6{\%}) or in hollow logs on the ground (2{\%}). We tested whether tree hollows provide a thermally distinct environment compared with alternative microhabitats, but found no difference in minimum, average, maximum or range of temperatures recorded between microhabitats. When within tree hollows over winter, pythons had colder daily average and maximum body temperatures (cf. pythons that used other microhabitats), but this did not give them an energy saving (in terms of body condition scores). Pythons ate very little over winter and we predict that animals sequestered within tree hollows do not access prey at this time. Tree hollows provide a critical refuge over winter when python body temperature is low, and their responsiveness is limited, rendering individuals vulnerable to predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. introduced red fox). Destruction of hollows through fire, land clearing, competition with other fauna species and the significant age required for hollows to form in trees all contribute to the decline in availability of this important microhabitat.",2012,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,286,,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00852.x,0952-8369,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""81"", ""end_page"": ""92"", ""primary_date"": ""2012-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Tree hollows are of conservation importance for a Near-Threatened python species"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

To represent the spatially and temporally constrained, interspecific interactions among reef fishes we employ Atlantis (a spatially explicit, biogeochemical ecosystem model) as our simulation tool. Within Atlantis, we evaluate the performance of a two-point harvest control rule (HCR) that adaptively increases fishing mortality linearly between upper and lower biomass thresholds based on the available biomass of the stocks. This example demonstrated the use of a blanket two-point HCR that assessed the available biomass of several reef fish species (often co-caught in fishing gear) both simultaneously and objectively. To estimate the impact of reef fish fishing on species abundance and biodiversity in the ecosystem, we examined four low and four high fishing mortality (F) scaler scenarios. All model projections are forward looking, representing a 50-year time horizon (2010 to 2060). We evaluated the performance of the two-point HCRs under the eight fishing mortality scenarios using ecosystem metrics that were previously found to robustly track changes in ecosystem function caused by fishing. We found that the lower F scenarios produced an ecologically distinct ecosystem state compared with the higher F scenarios, where relatively higher levels of fishing mortality (particularly on predators such as the deep Serranidae group) resulted in an increase in prey availability in later years of the simulation. This led to an increase in the overall productivity of the ecosystem over time and higher catch and biomass of most other reef fish groups at equilibrium (year 50).

Insight on the topic of speciation can be provided by focusing on adaptive radiations, because of the rapid amount of lineages that have arisen within a short natural historical time frame. Rockfishes (genus: Sebastes) are known as a system for adaptive radiations within marine systems and have been considered an ancient species flock. This dissertation concentrates on marine rockfishes from the subgenus ((Pteropodus) and closely related congeners to make inferences about speciation and adaptation within marine systems. Brain, kidney, testes, ovaries, and spleen tissues were selected from multiple rockfish species to extract total RNA in order to sequence the transcriptome with the use of Sanger and next generation sequencing techniques. These tissues types are intended to give us a broad spectrum of the rockfish transcriptome and were utilized to identify genes subject to positive selection. Pair-wise and multiple species comparisons were conducted to identify orthologous sequence pairs between/among species and estimated nonsynonymous (K sub(a)) and synonymous (K sub(s)) substitutions. In the first study, a comparative analysis of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from Sebastes caurinus and S. rastrelliger was conducted to identify candidate genes under positive selection within the subgenus (Pteropodus. Genes with elevated Ka/Ks values belonged to the following functional categories: immune function, metabolism, longevity, and reproductive behavior, indicating that adaptive divergence at immunological, physiological, and reproductive loci may be important in the diversification of this group of fishes. In the second study, ESTs from S. goodei and S. saxicola, a pair of related congeners to (Pteropodus, were utilized for identifying positive selection with the use of testes and ovary tissue types. Gonadal tissues were selected from these two species to elucidate patterns of adaptation and speciation because of their recognition to contribute to reproductive barriers between species. Sequence divergence was estimated within the untranslated regions (UTRs) between these two species and was compared with the rate of divergence within coding regions of these genes to gain a clear depiction of neutral substitutional mutation rates. Orthologous gene pairs between the two species were identified and tested for positive selection. In addition, a candidate gene approach from the zona pellucida (ZP) family was selected to determine whether these genes are under positive selection. In the third study of this dissertation, a multi-transcriptomic comparison was conducted, in which three (Pteropodus species were analyzed with the addition of S. rastrelliger and S. caurinus datasets to identify a pattern of positive selection within this subgenus. Brain tissue was used to gain the most diverse set of transcripts from the rockfish genome. Genes under positive selection belonged to a variety of gene functions that included sensory perception, growth, and metabolism. In addition we identified 10 sequences under positive selection that were part of the phosphatidylinositol signaling system pathway, although genes under positive selection had a broad range of gene functions and genes identified under positive selection across all five (Pteropodus species were not identified in the first study. These collections of studies are intended to further advance the field of evolutionary biology by providing support of which functional genes are important for adaptation and speciation. Currently, there is no rockfish genome available, in which by sequencing the transcriptome this provides a foundation for future genomic projects to gain a better understanding about the genus. This dissertation was developed to determine whether traditional gene categories, which are known to be under positive selection such as immune function, reproduction, and apoptosis, also play an important role in marine speciation.

Computer models of varying complexity are able to produce regional-scale storm tide flood maps and current model types are either static or dynamic in their implementation. Static models of storm tide utilize storm tide heights to inundate locations hydrologically connected to the coast, whilst dynamic models simulate physical processes that cause flooding. Static models have been used in regional-scale storm tide flood impact assessments, but model limitations and coarse spatial resolutions contribute to uncertain impact estimates. Dynamic models are better at estimating flooding and impact but are computationally expensive. In this study we have developed a dynamic reduced-complexity model of storm tide flooding that is computationally efficient and is applied at hyper-resolutions (<100 m cell size) over regional scales. We test the performance of this dynamic reduced-complexity model and a separate static model at three test sites where storm tide observational data are available. Additionally, we perform a flood impact assessment at each site using the dynamic reduced-complexity and static model outputs.

Thus, the enumeration of sedimentation rates provides a basis for reconstructing the processes responsible for historic landscape change. These data also provide a basis for predicting landscape change that can accompany hydrologic reconnection of impounded wetlands to the Indian River Lagoon. In this investigation, conducted in the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, Florida, we used cesium activity profiles to quantify rates of historic sediment accumulation at locations subject to managed (impounded) and unmanaged (natural) surface water hydrology. The data suggest impounded wetlands subject to historic submergence are now devoid of vegetation and experiencing substrate erosion in areas in which fetch is sufficient to induce wind-driven circulation. In unmanaged wetlands, surface elevations have kept pace with historic sea level rise solely through the in situ accumulation of organic matter. These observations suggest that hydrologic reconnection of impounded wetlands subject to persistent flooding throughout historic time will result in rapid and widespread submergence to water depths in excess of 10 to 20 cm. At these depths, most wetland plant taxa will not successfully recruit via seedling exchange. Hence, attempts to restore wetland areas analogous to those investigated during this study (i.e., Impoundment D) cannot be achieved simply by removing management structures that obstruct natural surface water flow. The wetland surface must either be (1) incrementally flooded to estuarine water level elevations slowly over time or (2) raised to the appropriate hydroperiod elevation before reconnection with suitable fill material. One possible source of fill is the Intracoastal Waterway, located within 2 kin of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and intermittently dredged to maintain safe navigation.",2006,,"{""DeLaune, Ron R"",""Hutcherson, Charles T"",""Parkinson, Randall W"",""Stewart, Joseph""}",,journal,22,5,10.2112/06a.0009.1,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""1268"", ""end_page"": ""1277"", ""primary_date"": ""2006-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Tuning surface water management and wetland restoration programs with historic sediment accumulation rates: Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, East-Central Florida, USA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('DeLaune, Ron R', 'Hutcherson, Charles T', 'Parkinson, Randall W', 'Stewart, Joseph')""}"

In this study the effects of small boat harbours on the mobile epibenthic fauna (shrimps, crabs and small fishes) and infauna (mussels, worms and small crustaceans) were investigated. Quantitative samples of the fauna were taken in 10 small boat harbours and in 6 reference areas. Seven of the harbors were ""basin-harbours"", i.e. with a narrow inlet which reduced the water exchange, and 3 were ""open harbours"". The reference areas were similar to the basin-harbours as regards reduced water exchange. The number of species and biomass of mobile epibenthic fauna and infauna were significantly lower in basin-harbours compared to reference areas and harbours of open construction. The impoverishment of the fauna in the basin-harbours was probably due to the combined effects of enclosure (limitation of water circulation), dredging (alteration of sediment and elimination of vegetation) and leakage of toxic substances (e.g. copper and organic tin in antifouling paint as well as fuel and oil from engines).

Algal responses to OA may vary because increasing CO2 has the potential to fertilize photosynthesis but impair biomineralization. Using a series of repeated experiments on Palmyra Atoll, simulated OA effects were tested across a suite of ecologically important coral reef algae, including five fleshy and six calcareous species. Growth, calcification and photophysiology were measured for each species independently and metrics were combined from each experiment using a meta-analysis to examine overall trends across functional groups categorized as fleshy, upright calcareous, and crustose coralline algae (CCA). The magnitude of the effect of OA on algal growth response varied by species, but the direction was consistent within functional groups. Exposure to OA conditions generally enhanced growth in fleshy macroalgae, reduced net calcification in upright calcareous algae, and caused net dissolution in CCA. Additionally, three of the five fleshy seaweeds tested became reproductive upon exposure to OA conditions. There was no consistent effect of OA on algal photophysiology. Our study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that OA will reduce the ability of calcareous algae to biomineralize. Further, we show that CO2 enrichment either will stimulate population or somatic growth in some species of fleshy macroalgae.

The mean nutritional composition of each dish was calculated per 100g using the nutribase clinical nutrition manager (Cybersoft Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA). Results A total of 79 recipes were collected for 16 commonly consumed dishes (seven meat-based, five starch-based and four legume/vegetable-based). Fried chicken' contained the most energy [1469kJ (351kcal)], protein (29.7g), fat (23.7g), cholesterol (123mg) and niacin (8.4mg). Fried beef' contained the most potassium (495mg) and zinc (6.4mg), whereas fish stew' had the most vitamin D (4.2g) and calcium (215mg).

GL concentration varied both spatially and temporally, with values of 1.1-21.5 mu g/L and 0.4-44.7 mu g/L in the particulate and the dissolved fraction, respectively. The highest concentrations were measured during summer in surface waters and at the more oligotrophic station, where GL yields ({\%} of total lipids) were often higher than 20{\%} and 50{\%} in the particulate and dissolved fractions, respectively. To obtain more insight into factors governing GL accumulation autotrophic plankton community structure (pico-, nano- and microplankton fractions), chlorophyll a, heterotrophic bacteria and nutrient concentrations were measured together with hydrographic parameters and sunlight intensity. During the investigated period smaller autotrophic plankton cells (pico- and followed by nanoplankton) prevailed in abundance over larger cells (microplankton), which were found in large numbers in freshened surface samples. Several major findings resulted from the study. Firstly, during PO4 limitation, particularly at the oligotrophic station, enhanced glycolipid instead of phospholipid accumulation takes place, representing an effective phosphate-conserving mechanism. Secondly, results suggest that at seawater temperatures {\textgreater}19 degrees C autotrophic plankton considerably accumulate GL, probably to achieve thermal stability. Thirdly, high sunlight intensities seem to influence increased GL accumulation; GL possibly plays a role in cell mechanisms that prevent/mitigate photooxidation. And finally, substantial accumulation of GL detected in the dissolved fraction could be related to the fact that GL do not contain biologically relevant elements, like phosphorus, which makes them an unattractive substrate for enzyme activity. Therefore, substantial portion of CO2 could be removed from the atmosphere in P-limited regions during summer via its capture by plankton and conversion to GL. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In PAO concentrations of a-hexachlorocyclohexane, heptachlor and hexachlorobenzene were positively correlated with the weight of the individuals. Lipid peroxidation levels were positively correlated with cadmium concentrations. In turtles captured in PAO, enzymatic antioxidant activities correlated mostly with pesticide concentrations, while in individuals from BMA enzyme activities were correlated with trace element concentrations. Correlations between antioxidant enzyme activities and concentration of xenobiotics suggest physiological sensitivity of East Pacific green turtles to chemicals. Regional differences found could be influenced by habitat conditions such as currents, upwellings (PAO) and agricultural activities (BMA). We suggest that, combined, circulating contaminant concentrations, lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant enzyme activities in sea turtles could be used as biomarkers of the habitat conditions.

Ponds within IAA farming systems sequester more carbon per unit area than conventional fish ponds, natural lakes, and inland seas. The translocation of shrimp culture from mangrove swamps to offshore IMTA could reduce mangrove loss, reverse blue carbon emissions, and in turn increase storage of blue carbon through restoration of mangroves. Moreover, offshore IMTA may create a barrier to trawl fishing which in turn could help restore seagrasses and further enhance blue carbon sequestration. Seaweed and shellfish culture within IMTA could also help to sequester more blue carbon.

This paper places MHM practices in context with biodiversity models and EBM. Marine habitat mapping is shown to be a critical process closely integrated with much needed progress on the broader topic of EBM. Advances in MHM and EBM depend on evolving technological capabilities, conservation targets, and policy priorities within a spatial planning framework. In both cases, the evolving and adaptive nature of these sciences require explicit spatial parameters, clear objectives, combinations of social and scientific considerations, and multiple parameters to assess overlapping viewpoints and ecosystem functions. To examine the commonalities between MHM and EBM, we also address issues of implicit and explicit linkages between classification, mapping, and elements of biodiversity with management goals.

Changes in fish abundances may influence not only their forage organisms, but indirectly also species at other trophic levels. The ecological role of fish in lakes is so well established that fish manipulations are used in e.g. mitigation of eutrophication. The significance of fish in marine environments is much less understood, but there is no obvious reason why fish should be less integrated in marine ecosystems than in lakes. Fisheries thus have a potentially tremendous ecological impact through the killing of target species. These species are normally very abundant and/or dominant on their trophic level. For many of these species, the fishery increases the mortality rate >500%. Most other human activities (e.g. discharges of toxic substances) that increase mortality rates to this extent would probably be banned! This comparison shows that fisheries must be managed to avoid unacceptable ecological effects and not primarily to optimise catches.

Here we used the Niobe fritillary (Argynnis niobe) as a study system to analyse the larval habitat preferences in a small network of heavy-metal grasslands in western Germany. The data were compared with the results of a previous study in coastal dune grasslands of the German North Sea. Based on this knowledge, we give management recommendations for the conservation of this threatened species. The key factors for the survival of A. niobe in heavy-metal grasslands were (i) open vegetation with a warm microclimate and (ii) sufficient host plants for the larvae. This reflects similar results from the previous study in coastal grey dune grasslands. However, in the heavy-metal grasslands, physiological stress generally slows down succession and favours the fritillary's host plant, the metallophyte Viola calaminaria. As a result, the cover of the host plant was nearly twice as high in heavy-metal grasslands compared to the dune grasslands. Heavy-metal grasslands are of great significance for the conservation of A. niobe and overall butterfly diversity. Usually, the speed of succession in heavy-metal grasslands is slow and, hence, sites with high heavy-metal concentrations are characterised by relatively stable plant composition and vegetation structure. However, on soils with low heavy-metal content a loss of habitats of A. niobe and associated species of conservation concern may occur without management.

Part I: The north-western Mediterranean Sea,,"Contrasting to the overall oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea, the north-western basin is characterised by high productivity and marked by seasonality, which induces spatiotemporal heterogeneity of habitat. Cetaceans and seabirds are expected to perceive this repetition of the seasonal cycle and to anticipate the recurrent variability of their environment. Because phenology imposes strong constraints over marine predators, especially through reproduction, we expected them to exhibit variations in their habitat preferences over seasons. Indeed, during reproductive period, marine predators have to face their own needs and those of their young, while out of this period, they can focus on maximising their own survival only. We therefore hypothesised that some species would change their habitat preferences to exploit the most favourable habitat during each season, while other species might accommodate the same habitat all year-round, for example thanks to the use of an habitat favourable all the year. To explore these hypotheses, we used aerial surveys data conducted over north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2011-2012 and summer 2012. Generalised Additive Models were used to link the species density to a set of 12 physiographic and oceanographic predictors describing their environment. Habitat models resulted in deviances from 12 to 47%. Our results provided the first assessment of habitat preferences for the winter season for most of our studied species. Small-sized delphinids (mostly stripped dolphins), fin whales, Globicephalinae (long-finned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins) and small-sized shearwaters (Yelkouan and Balearic shearwaters) exhibited no habitat variations between seasons, although for the first two, abundances were lower in winter. On the contrary, bottlenose dolphins switched from coastal habitat in summer to pelagic habitat in winter, while Cory's shearwaters and storm petrels exhibited the largest habitat variations between seasons with a complete absence during winter.

This dissertation aimed to determine whether (1) viruses caused significant mortality of bacteria and whether mortality rate scaled with the production rate of host assemblages; (2) enhancement of viral pressure enhances host assemblage richness and diversity; and (3) whether a virus-pressure-host diversity relationship exists across water masses of different trophic status. To address these questions, two high-throughput fingerprinting approaches were used to examine all bacteria (automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis; ARISA) and a subset of these with presumably low relative abundance, diazotrophs (nifH terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism; nifH TRFLP), in response to changes in viral pressure. Ambient viral pressure across several habitats, including sediments, was determined using a viral dilution technique. Viral pressure upon host communities was enhanced by concentrating native viruses and adding them back to seawater and sediment incubations. Viruses may cause significant mortality of bacteria across most habitats, which is not related to primary production rates, nor the same within similar water masses (i.e. patchy viral impacts upon bacterioplankton). Enhancement of viral pressure in 15 incubations in 3 ocean basins showed that this treatment had significant impacts upon measured parameters at most stations. However the impacts on parameters were not consistent among experiment locations. Moreover, enhancement of viral pressure had no discernible impact upon the relative dominance of common microbial fingerprint components in plankton, but significant negative impacts on common components matched with significant positive impacts on rarer components in sediment experiments. Correlation analysis of viral parameters and the abundance, productivity, relative richness and diversity of bacterioplankton and diazotrophs indicate that overall diversity of host assemblages may be related to their habitat and resource availability, but viruses have significant impacts upon their assemblages within habitats. The data in this dissertation suggest that viruses may have a more complicated role in shaping host assemblages in marine environments than previously believed, made more complex by the inclusion of a diverse dissolved organic matter pool, resistant bacteria, and lysogens.",2005,,"{""Hewson, Ian""}",,book,,,,9780542205903,"ProQuest Information & Learning, 300 N Zeeb Rd.

We summarize current knowledge about the effectiveness of these techniques for improving physical habitat and water quality and increasing fish and biotic production. Despite locating 345 studies on effectiveness of stream rehabilitation, firm conclusions about many specific techniques were difficult to make because of the limited information provided on physical habitat, water quality, and biota and because of the short duration and limited scope of most published evaluations. Reconnection of isolated habitats, floodplain rehabilitation, and instream habitat improvement have, however, proven effective for improving habitat and increasing local fish abundance under many circumstances. Techniques such as riparian rehabilitation, road improvements (sediment reduction), dam removal, and restoration of natural flood regimes have shown promise for restoring natural processes that create and maintain habitats, but no long-term studies documenting their success have yet been published. Our review demonstrates that the failure of many rehabilitation projects to achieve objectives is attributable to inadequate assessment of historic conditions and factors limiting biotic production; poor understanding of watershed-scale processes that influence localized projects; and monitoring at inappropriate spatial and temporal scales.

Although traditional population-genetic tools can be applied to infer movement of larvae on an evolutionary timescale, large effective population sizes and high rates of gene flow present serious challenges to documenting dispersal patterns over shorter, ecologically relevant, timescales. Here, we address these challenges by combining direct parentage analysis and indirect genetic analyses over a 4-year period to document spatial and temporal patterns of larval dispersal in a common coral-reef fish: the bicolour damselfish (Stegastes partitus). At four island locations surrounding Exuma Sound, Bahamas, including a long-established marine reserve, we collected 3278 individuals and genotyped them at 10 microsatellite loci. Using Bayesian parentage analysis, we identified eight parent-offspring pairs, thereby directly documenting dispersal distances ranging from 0 km (i.e., self-recruitment) to 129 km (i.e., larval connectivity). Despite documenting substantial dispersal and gene flow between islands, we observed more self-recruitment events than expected if the larvae were drawn from a common, well-mixed pool (i.e., a completely open population). Additionally, we detected both spatial and temporal variation in signatures of sweepstakes and Wahlund effects. The high variance in reproductive success (i.e., 'sweepstakes') we observed may be influenced by seasonal mesoscale gyres present in the Exuma Sound, which play a prominent role in shaping local oceanographic patterns. This study documents the complex nature of larval dispersal in a coral-reef fish, and highlights the importance of sampling multiple cohorts and coupling both direct and indirect genetic methods in order disentangle patterns of dispersal, gene flow and variable reproductive success.",2014,,"{""Christie, Mark R"",""Hixon, Mark A"",""Johnson, Darren W"",""Pusack, Timothy J"",""Stallings, Christopher D""}",,journal,23,14,10.1111/mec.12824,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""3396"", ""end_page"": ""3408"", ""primary_date"": ""2014-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Spatial and temporal patterns of larval dispersal in a coral-reef fish metapopulation: evidence of variable reproductive success"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Christie, Mark R', 'Hixon, Mark A', 'Johnson, Darren W', 'Pusack, Timothy J', 'Stallings, Christopher D')""}"

They possess a unique mix of tropical, subtropical, and temperate marine species, and although close to continental South America, elements of the biota have greater affinities with the central and south Pacific owing to the Humboldt Current, which creates a strong biogeographic barrier between these islands and the continent. The Juan Fernandez Archipelago has similar to 700 people, with the major industry being the fishery for the endemic lobster, Jasus frontalis. The Desventuradas Islands are uninhabited except for a small Chilean military garrison on San Felix Island. We compared the marine biodiversity of these islands across multiple taxonomic groups.

The resource, situated along the Laos-Cambodia border, supports the livelihoods of around 65,000 inhabitants, mainly semi-subsistence rice farmers or fishers. In January 2000, the provincial authority was given a special dispensation by the Lao government to allow the importation of Cambodian fish through Khong district, for export to Thailand. Previously, in large part due to the government's policy of food self-sufficiency, the export of Lao fish was illegal. This paper examines how the implementation of this law has influenced existing legal and illegal trade networks from the Siiphandone fishery by comparing the findings of two studies, one conducted before and the other after the change in the law.

Levelling the playing field?,,"Marine spatial planning (MSP) is the leading tool for managing human activities at sea. It is designed to assist in decision making for marine resource access and use by considering the actions of those using the resources, interactions between these groups, and their cumulative impact on the natural environment. Being informed by ecosystem based management, MSP recognises that socio-natural systems are complex and that stakeholder and public input are key components of well-informed decision making. Therefore, MSP is rooted in the principles of good governance, including those of participation and transparency. This paper considers MSP processes in Scotland's inshore waters in the context of these good governance principles. The focus is on the institutional arrangements that allow stakeholders and the public to contribute to planning Scotland's seas and coasts. Whilst acknowledging the significant challenges faced by planners, and the work conducted so far, this research suggests that improvements could be made in how and when engagement takes place. It appears that at an early stage of introducing MSP in Scotland powerful stakeholders shaped the images, values and principles that guide it, and that including a broader range of actors early on might positively affect the legitimacy and acceptance of MSP in its later stages. The current institutional arrangements do not appear to allow for this. Ultimately, MSP in Scotland is in danger of institutionalising and thus legitimising existing power relations between marine resource users, and it does little to level the playing field.",2017,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,84,,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.06.024,0308-597X,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""33"", ""end_page"": ""41"", ""primary_date"": ""2017-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Marine spatial planning in Scotland.

Information from a previous study suggested that following impoundment of Truman Lake, high harvest and possible low recruitment have jeopardized the excellent blue catfish fishery below Truman Dam. Catfish harvest characteristics were measured by creel survey and population characteristics were determined using various sampling gears. Although annual catfish fishing pressure was relatively stable (2,590-3,812 h/ha), fishing pressure was 20-50 times higher in the tailwater area than in the downstream portion of the study area. Annual harvest of catfish in each area was about 6,000 blue catfish and 3,000 channel catfish, and harvest of both species was highest in the downstream area during the last 3 years of study. Harvest of catfish in the Truman Dam tailwater was positively correlated to flow from the dam. Remote-operated boats were effective harvest aids for large blue catfish that concentrate immediately below the dam, Most blue catfish were age-6 and 432 mm long and channel catfish were about age-6 or 7 and 330 or 356 mm when they began entering the harvest. Total annual mortality estimates for blue catfish ranged 12-32{\%} and estimates for channel catfish wen 33-83{\%}. Forty percent of all tagged blue catfish were reported captured downstream of the study areas, whereas only 24{\%} of tagged channel catfish were captured in downstream areas. We believe that current levels of natural recruitment are adequate for maintaining the blue catfish fishery. Numbers of harvested catfish {\textless}381 mm decreased from 27{\%} during an earlier study to 6{\%} during this study; however, release rates of fish {\textless}381 mm increased significantly from less than 6{\%} during the early study to an average 98{\%} during our study. Age at length analysis also indicated that all age-classes of catfish were represented. Blue catfish in the Truman Dam tailwater are now managed to take advantage of their potential for large size and longevity. Results have led to several regulation changes for catfish. These changes reduced the daily aggregate limit to four catfish allowed only one harvested catfish to exceed 609 mm, and established a no fishing zone (approximately 4 ha) immediately below Truman Dam.",1999,,{NA},{NA},Book Section,24,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""361"", ""end_page"": ""376"", ""primary_date"": ""1999-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""The population and fishery of blue catfish and channel catfish in the Harry S Truman Dam tailwater, Missouri"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Aegean Sea),,"The east Atlantic-Mediterranean penaeid Melicertus kerathurus constitutes a valuable resource for Mediterranean fisheries. In recent years, its world production is almost totally based on the yields from Greece and Tunisia. A two-year study of prawn stock in Thermaikos Gulf (NW Aegean Sea) provided information on age, growth and mortality of the species. M. kerathurus exhibits a marked sexual growth dimorphism, with females showing an overall wider size range and greater size than males. Mean monthly size. CLmax were also in favor of females. Monthly age classes varied from one to four for females and from one to three for males, and corresponded to three generations (0(+), 1(+), 2(+)). New generation (0(+)) cohorts recruited into fishery in waves, from late summer to February. According to the von Bertalanffy growth curve, females grow larger than males, but there is a prominent seasonal growth oscillation in both sexes (females: CL infinity = 62.48, K = 1.15, C = 0.87, WP = 0.16, Rn =0.170; males: CL infinity = 47.78, K = 1.28, C = 0.97, WP = 0.12, Rn = 0.205). Growth performance indices (phi', phi) and longevity were in favor of females. K values for both sexes in Thermaikos Gulf are the highest reported for the species, suggesting a higher growth rate and a lower longevity. Estimated values for total, natural and fishery mortality were greater in males. In both sexes, an exploitation rate E {\textgreater} 0.5 was found, implying an intense fishing impact on M. kerathurus stock in Thermaikos Gulf. Intense exploitation in other parts of the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, along with the replacement of the species by Eritrean penaeid prawns in the eastern Mediterranean, has resulted in a severe reduction in catches, in most countries. Thus, existing stocks of M. kerathurus should be considered as potentially endangered, and species-specific initiatives towards sustainable management of this resource should be implemented.

Crop Energy Balance (y) is defined as the difference between the energy equivalents of feed taken by the cattle and the energy equivalents of the output from cattle in the form of dung and milk per day per cattle. The variable Crop Energy Balance (y) is the dependent variable being predicted by a set of 14 independent variables. Study was conducted at Saharpara village of Haringhata, in district Nadia of West Bengal. The respondents have been 50 by count and have been selected through both the purposive and random sampling approaches to ultimately derive and elicit their behavioural traits in the energy balances of social, economic, physical and ecological setup. The results show that following new factors, Farm Economy Index, Personal Capacity, Family Resources, Family Motivation have led to consciousness about the energy balances in social ecology and impact of these energy balances on the ecosystem as whole. The Multiple correlation results show Age (X1) has positive significant correlation with Crop Energy Balance (y) whereas the variables Education (X2), Homstead Land Size (X9) and Age (X1) have had significant impact on the predictant y. All these analytical outcomes can be replicated to other enterprises as well to calculate energy balances.

The assessment of such processes has traditionally been performed by calculating average cliff recession rates and projecting them into the future, without taking into consideration the diverse factors affecting cliff dynamics and stability. In this work a new, practical method is presented to evaluate cliff erosion risk in temperate environments, by analysing the main factors responsible for both the physical and the socioeconomic aspects of erosion, representing cliff loss potential and damage potential, respectively. For this purpose an integration of 11 physical variables (such as cliff lithology, beach characteristics or rainfall regime) and 6 socioeconomic variables (such as land use type or population density) is proposed. These variables are weighted and combined into a Hazard Index and an Impact Index, which in turn are merged into a composite Risk Index where the resulting values are normalized and expressed as a percentage of the maximum theoretical risk. The method is tested and validated by using data about cliff retreat rates and mass movement processes in the coast of Cadiz province (SW Spain). The proposed approach allows the zoning of coastal cliffs according to the risk, hazard and/or impact levels, including the recognition of critical areas where specific intervention strategies should be adopted. The method presented in this work is deemed both practical and scientifically valid, without requiring extensive and detailed surveys of the area where it is to be applied. This way, it constitutes an easy to use, valuable tool for decision-making regarding land use planning and management strategies for active coastal cliffs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

These communities are presently threatened by a combination of anthropogenic impacts partly related to global change. Managers of MPAs are increasingly concerned about the capacity of coralligenous communities to endure crowds of divers, and there is a call for descriptors and for quantitative methods for estimating this capacity. A good indicator to detect the impacts on coralligenous communities should gather the following essential traits: to be a long-lived, clonal, engineering species displaying an erect shape and a large size in order to facilitate the monitoring. Among the main taxonomic groups of the coralligenous, gorgonians display several advantages and, in this study, the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata was selected as a model species to evaluate the effects of diving impact and climate change on coralligenous communities. We present three cases of study about the demographic monitoring of red gorgonian populations affected by the 1999 mass mortality event (Port-Cros) and subjected to high diving activity (Medes Islands and Cap de Creus). Finally, combining all these data we simulate the interacting effects of divers damage and mass mortality events on the persistence of gorgonian populations. The results of long-term monitoring of permanent plots allowed showing that although diving activity affects significantly the red gorgonian populations, the effect of climate change has more significant effects on the populations. Port-Cros populations affected by the 1999 mass mortality suffered a 60% biomass loss that has not been recovered in the following eight years. Simulations showed that the combination of both disturbances can have large and lasting effects on the future viability of red gorgonian populations. As gorgonian assemblages are only one facies of the coralligenous communities, other species should be selected for detecting the impact on these communities. Nevertheless, the development of similar demographic approaches for other species would be more difficult than for gorgonians.",2010,,"{""Coma, Rafel"",""Dantart, Lluis"",""Diaz, David"",""Garrabou, Joaquim"",""Hereu, Bernat"",""Linares, Cristina"",""Zabala, Mikel""}",,journal,24,,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""161"", ""end_page"": ""184"", ""primary_date"": ""2010-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Assessing the impact of diving in coralligenous communities : The usefulness of demographic studies of red gorgonian populations"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Coma, Rafel', 'Dantart, Lluis', 'Diaz, David', 'Garrabou, Joaquim', 'Hereu, Bernat', 'Linares, Cristina', 'Zabala, Mikel')""}"

The objective was to survey upstream migration in the river, of which 70 km are channeled. The behavior of 126 salmon was studied at 26 weirs (approximately 2 m high) from the beginning of July 1999 to the middle of December 2000. The mean percentage of fish able to pass upstream of weirs fitted with older fish passage facilities was less than for more recent fishways installed since 1994. An evaluation of the cumulative effect of the weirs indicates that only 2-3% of returning adults are likely to pass through the channeled part of the river and reach upstream areas with suitable habitat for spawning. The most obvious blockages occurred at weirs in the lowermost portion of the channeled river. Environmental conditions such as low flows and poor water quality may also make it difficult for salmon entering the river to progress upstream. Moreover, salmon appear to exhibit nontypical migration behaviors in this environment, which is heavily influenced by human activities. More than 26% of returning adults migrated downstream during the study, leaving the Aulne before the spawning period began and entering and migrating upstream through other neighboring rivers. We also estimated the impact of fishing on upstream migrants, which appeared far greater for spring salmon than for grilse.

Ocean acidification (OA) is increasingly recognized by marine scientists as an important, but often overlooked, consequence of anthropogenic emissions(1,2). Although substantial evidence now exists concerning people's understanding of climate change more generally(3), very little is known about public perceptions of OA. Here, for the first time, we characterize in detail people's understanding of this topic using survey data obtained in Great Britain (n = 2,501) during 2013 and 2014. We draw on theories of risk perception and consider how personal values influence attitudes towards OA.

The ability of a marsh to sustain itself by vertical accretion in response to sea-level rise is, in part, limited by inorganic sediment supply. Models attempting to forecast salt-marsh response to future sea-level rise commonly ignore land-use changes, despite the recent coastal population boom and the potential of land-use changes to alter sediment sources and modify established sediment-transport pathways. This study investigates the impacts of landscape modifications, which are typical of coastal areas, on the nearshore sedimentation and edge evolution of two fringing marshes. The sites examined include a marsh fringing the upper bay and a marsh fringing a beach ridge on the estuarine shoreline of a barrier island. Both sites are located in the same estuarine system, have similar hydrologic settings and comparable vegetation densities. Previous work, marsh cores, and a historical record from aerial photos indicate that although the fringe marshes are in different geomorphic locations, prior to anthropogenic modifications they were similar in terms of nearshore-sediment composition, scarp-shoreline morphology, and shoreline trajectory. The upper-bay marsh was impacted by the introduction of tree farming in the watershed of a tributary creek to the upper bay, which increased upland erosion and caused higher sedimentation rates in the estuary. The back-barrier marsh, which received no contribution from the tree farm because it is distal with respect to river input, was modified by the installation of a pier and rock sill. Terrestrial LIDAR, surface elevation tables, and accretion rates obtained from radioisotope analyses show that the deforestation induced high rates of nearshore and marsh accretion at the upper-bay site, which is promoting marsh colonization and expansion. These same types of data, in addition to aerial photos, were obtained at the back-barrier site and show increased rates of marsh-shoreline erosion adjacent to the structures. The fringing marshes were once similar, but started to evolve differently over a short time period as a result of human-induced changes to the landscape. Coastal development can significantly influence marsh-shoreline behavior, which must be taken into account when developing models of coastal response to sea-level rise.

A critical issue in managing invasive species is determining the relative roles of ongoing introductions, versus the local movement of propagules from established source populations. Styela clava (Herdman, 1882), the Asian clubbed tunicate, once restricted to the Pacific shores of Asia and Russia, is now abundant throughout the northern and southern hemispheres and has had significant economic impact in at least one site of incursion. In 2005 S. clava was identified in New Zealand. The recent introduction of this species, coupled with its restricted distribution, provided an ideal model to compare and contrast the introduction and expansion process. In this study, the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) gene and 11 microsatellite markers were used to test the regional genetic structure and diversity of 318 S. clava individuals from 10 populations within New Zealand. Both markers showed significant differentiation between the northern and southern populations, indicative of minimal pre- or post-border connectivity. Additional statistics further support pre- and post-border differentiation among Port and Harbour populations (i.e. marinas and aquaculture farms). We conclude that New Zealand receives multiple introductions, and that the primary vector for pre-border incursions and post-border spread is most likely the extensive influx of recreational vessels that enter northern marinas independent of the Port.

Chlorophyll a (Chi a), ranging from 3.05 mu g L(-1) in winter to 4.52 mu g L(-1) in summer, was dominated by the small size-faction (<5 mu m) during both seasons. However, the contribution of the large size-fraction (5-200 mu m) to Chi a increased from winter (26%) to summer (37%). Similarly, the carbon biomass of the 5-200 mu m algae increased during the July/August period that was characterised by the high proliferation of several diatom taxa. In winter, N was the limiting element for phytoplankton growth. Its addition alone (+N) or with P (+NP) increased both the <5 mu m and 5-200 mu m Chi a concentrations. There was no change in the phytoplankton size structure, with the small cells dominating the final algal biomass in all treatments after 5 days. In summer, N and P limited the phytoplankton, but small and large algae exhibited diverse responses to different nutrient enrichments: addition of P increased the Chi a only in the 5-200 mu m fraction, the +N treatment enhanced both size classes, and the NP fertilisation mostly stimulated the biomass of large cells. Consequently, the N and P addition in summer was followed by a significant change in the phytoplankton size structure, since both size-fractions contributed equally to the final Chi a biomass. Within the 5-200 mu m algal community, various taxa had diverse responses to the nutrient supply during both seasons, leading to a change in the final community composition. The autotrophic flagellates appeared to grow well under N-deficient conditions. In contrast, diatom growth and biomass were mostly stimulated by the N enrichment while dinoflagellates exhibited the highest increase in their growth and biomass with P fertilisation. Our results suggest that the increasing anthropogenic supply of nutrients in the lagoon may influence algal dynamics as well as productivity in different ways depending on the nutrient composition.

When H. erythrogramma was removed from unfenced plots, a slightly higher macroalgal biomass was observed in the austral summer, but this difference was not present a few months later. However, the drift biomass was 4 times higher in plots where sea urchins were not removed. The dominant macrophyte species in the drift were scarce or absent from the assemblage growing attached to the reef, suggesting that much of the drift originated elsewhere, either in adjacent seagrass beds or on reefs hundreds of metres to kilometres away.

Aquaculture diversification entails new challenges during early life stages of candidate species such as survival bottlenecks or body malformations, many of them due to uncoupling between classic diets and early nutritional requirements. Monospecific diets are common in fish aquaculture, e.g. beginning with a rotifer-based diet, followed by a mixed diet of rotifer and artemia nauplii and ending with artemia nauplii and metanauplii until weaning. Despite some success was reported using such protocol in early hake feeding the massive mortality observed as approaching 25 dph makes optimization of early feeding and larval management a current challenge for the domestication of this species. The main goal of this study was to design and test a workflow management system for early feeding of the European hake as a candidate species. The null hypothesis tested was that optimization of rearing settings had no effect on early growth and survival up to 30 dph as compared to classic culture protocols using commercial prey. Absence of prey in 6 dph hake larvae stomachs indicates that their external feeding at 14 degrees C begins just after that age. Early feeding preference depends on prey size (<500 mu m before 9 dph) as well as on pigmentation and behavior e.g. those with poor escape reactivity such as A. franciscana Nauplii. Significant feeding specialization on wild zooplankton such as P. intermedius and T. longicornis occurred after 9 dph (Chesson selectivity index = 0.11). Feeding activity was maximal in darkness (D) and medium light intensity (600 lx, MLI) as compared to the lethal light intensity of 1700 lx (HLI). Rotifer-based diets entailed low larvae growth and hake culture unviability after 15 dph but inclusion of wild zooplankton in early diets doubled growth of 30 dph larvae regarding artemia-based diets. The adaptive prey-size diet designed (MiACop) by combining stages of copepods (nauplii, copepodite and adult), rotifer and commercial nauplii of artemia was five-fold superior to the artemia/zooplankton diet all along the first 30 dph larvae culture. The massive cannibalism observed from 25 dph on was related to the absence of an adequate prey size such as that of mysids and euphausiids in combination with semidry feed to trigger weaning. Current workflow design for early feeding of the European hake can be helpful to assuring a larger proportion of juveniles entering the weaning phase.

Although it was designed to be used in European estuaries and coasts this index, based on Pearson and Rosenberg's model of responses to organic enrichment, is being used successfully worldwide. Taking into account statistical difficulties associated with the use of raw abundance data, modifications to the index were recently proposed. These included transforming abundances prior to its calculation, or to use data other than abundances which might be more functionally relevant (such as biomass or production data). Using data from the Basque coast and estuaries (northern Spain), collected between 1995 and 2009, where the evolution of human pressures and restoration actions in the area may be taken into account, the performance of AMBI is compared to that of the proposed modifications in order to assess their usefulness. Despite large variations in the form and nature of the input data, all variations of AMBI index are shown to be highly correlated, even when presence/absence data are used. New boundaries between disturbance categories were calculated, reflecting inter-relationships between different forms of the index. The disturbance classification obtained from all variations using the recalculated boundaries agreed closely with that derived from AMBI. The finding that AMBI values calculated with presence/absence data are potentially useful opens up many possibilities, such as determining the status of assemblages retrospectively using historical data.

The landings have decreased markedly since 1970, in spite of various restrictions such as a shorter fishing season, an increase in the minimum legal size of landed crabs, and a reduction of the maximum landed catch per trip. The failure of the stock to recover has been complicated by the inability of the Danish seine fleet to avoid capture of undersized crabs during both the crab and the flounder fishing seasons. To reduce the fishing pressure, six preserved areas totaling 67.8 km(2), equivalent to about 4.4{\%} of the total crab fishing grounds, were established off Kyoto Prefecture between 1983 and 2007. Artificial reefs made of concrete blocks were constructed in each of the six areas.

Disodium endothal at concentrations of 0.5 to 10.0ppmw was effective in controlling approximately 50% of the 19 species of plants involved in 270 tests. TD-47 at concentrations of 0.02 to 10.0 ppmw controlled 77% of the 11 plant species in 94 tests. Algae (Chara, Cladophora, Pithophora, and Spirogyra) were more effectively controlled by TD-47 than by disodium endothal. Although TD-47 was at least 10 times more herbicidal than disodium endothal, it was about 100 times more toxic to fish. Disodium endothal was more than 50% effective on submersed aquatic plants at rates in excess of 2.5 ppmw with a wide margin of safety in fish (4- to 10-fold). Disodium endothal had a median tolerance limit ranging from 95 to 150 ppmw in the aggregate of nine fish species tested extensively. Median tolerance limits for TD-47 ranged from about 0.06 to 0.3 ppmw for five species of fish. TD-47 applied at a concentration lethal to fish (0.3 to 1.0 ppmw) was effective as a dual management tool in controlling vegetation and achieving partial or complete renovation of stunted fish populations. Young, growing vegetation was most susceptible to control, and best results were achieved at water temperatures exceeding 60[degree] F. Higher rates were required to kill plants as they matured and stands became dense. Endothal liquid formulations were superior to granules in controlling algal mats, floating and emergent plants. Granules were more effectve on submersed rooted plants. TD-47 residues were of short duration. The rate of disappearance depended on time and concentration. Detectable residues disappeared within 8 days following application of 0.3 ppmw and within 2 weeks of 0.6 ppmw. However, 1.0 to 3.0 ppmw took up to 25 days to disappear. Some residues were found in fish-food organisms from treated enclosures 3 weeks after application. Fish flesh showed no absorption of endothal-armeens at sublethal concentrations. Intra-peritoneal injection of endothal into fish produced a disturbance of the osmoregulation. The physiological effect of endothal was measured by chemical analysis of blood serum. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author",1963,,"{""Walker, Charles R""}",,journal,11,(3),10.2307/4040590,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""226"", ""end_page"": ""232"", ""primary_date"": ""1963-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Endothal derivatives as aquatic herbicides in fishery habitats"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Walker, Charles R',)""}"

A vital component of this conversion for trap fisheries is the effective area fished by a trap. A conceptual model of interactions between traps set in strings that potentially allows estimation of trapping areas from trap-by-trap catch data predicted highest catch rates of lobsters and crabs in traps at the ends of strings. An individual-based simulation model developed to explore the effects of trap spacing, density, and agonistic behaviour at the trap shows that, in the absence of agonistic interactions at the trap (i.e., trap saturation), catch rates conform to those expected from the conceptual model, provided that trap exposure modifies the catchability at all traps equally. Trap saturation reduces the effect of trap interactions, particularly at high densities, and causes the relationship between capture probability and distance from the trap to depend on density. We discuss the application of the model to trap-by-trap data in practice and conclude that the approach may be valuable in an experimental context when direct methods of estimating effective area fished are not practicable.",2001,,"{""Addison, J T"",""Bannister, R C A"",""Bell, M C""}",,journal,52,8,10.1071/mf01175,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""1233"", ""end_page"": ""1242"", ""primary_date"": ""2001-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Estimating trapping areas from trap-catch data for lobsters and crabs"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Addison, J T', 'Bannister, R C A', 'Bell, M C')""}"

Our analyses provide strong evidence for a steady increase in nutrient concentrations and decrease in water transparency.

Similarly, water transparency decreased, especially in Lake Chamo, which used to have clear water but is now becoming a sediment-loaded lake similar to Lake Abaya. We reconstructed fertilizer use and land use changes in the region during the past decades. The combined data suggest that the dramatic eutrophication we observed in the lakes is likely associated with increased fertilizer use or other activities related to intensified agricultural practices, and the decline in water transparency is probably associated with low tree cover due to deforestation. The profound changes in the ecology of both lakes may jeopardize the delivery of ecosystem services in the region, including water supply, fisheries, and ecotourism.

Superimposed of these are factors of distance from the strandline (which determines the degree of wind effects), soil salinity, and height above water table (which is related to height above sealevel). These factors and processes have resulted in a range of geomorphic units, habitats and vegetation responses that can be recognized at various scales of reference. A consistent terminology for geomorphic units and habitats has been developed in order to compare tracts of Quindalup Dunes along the various sectors of the southern west coast of Western Australia. The large to medium scale geomorphic units include parabolic dunes, chaots (chatoic dune terrain), shore-parallel ridges, blowouts, undulating plain and flats. The small scale geomorphic units, that essentially equate with the basic vegetation habitats, are subdivisions of the larger scale geomorphic units; these include various slope units; crests and depressions of the large scale units.

The model used for the task is MyLake which is a one-dimensional deterministic model for lake ice and thermal stratification, which we modified to handle the effects of reservoir outflows. The model was first validated using observational datasets and it reproduced the vertical temperature profiles of the reservoirs, the withdrawal temperatures, and the ice cover dynamics reasonably well. The mean absolute error for vertical temperature predictions ranged from 0.7 degrees C to 1.13 degrees C. The validated model was then applied to investigate the impacts of climate change on the ice cover regime, the seasonal temperature profiles in general and the withdrawal water temperatures in particular. The climate change model forcings come from the medium level emission scenario A1B and two global circulation models (GCMs), which are dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model (RCM). Some of the predicted effects of climate change include: a reduction in ice cover duration ranging between 15 to 44 days in 2050s and 27 to 81 days in 2080s, depending on the scenarios and hydro-climatic conditions of the reservoirs. As a consequence of this, the period of stratification is lengthened by 20-31 days in 2050s, and 22-36 days in 2080s.

Digestive enzyme (trypsin, amylase) activities, growth, and biochemical composition (dry weight, CHN, protein, lipid) were also measured in short intervals (every 2-4 days) in herbivorous larvae, as well as in two control groups that were fed with Artemia sp. nauplii and deprived completely of food, respectively. Only with Artemia or B. sinensis as food were daily feeding rates high enough to detect patterns of variation during individual larval moult cycles: in both of these experimental groups, early postmoult and late premoult ingestion rates were consistently lowest, while maximum values occurred in the middle (zoea I), somewhat earlier (zoea II), or near the beginning (megalopa) of the moult cycle. Similarity between carnivorous and herbivorous larvae suggests that these patterns of variation in daily feeding rates are controlled by internal factors, whereas the average quantities ingested depend on food quality.

Average activities per individual decreased in both enzymes in the same order of experiments as total amounts of C ingested (see above), however, these differences were less conspicuous in the final larval instar, the megalopa. Individual activities of trypsin and amylase showed in most cases (i.e. larval instars, experimental conditions) significant positive correlations. Protein-specific activities (units per gram protein) showed complicated patterns of variation, reflecting differential changes in individual activities and biomass. In spite of positive correlations between individual activities of these two enzymes, shifts were observed in the amylase/trypsin activity ratio. In general, there was a relative increase in amylase under conditions of malnutrition (again, this was more conspicuous in the zoeal stages than in the megalopa). These shifts are interpreted as a response of the digestive system to changes in food quality (substrate availability) and instar requirements; in the case of amylase, co-regulation with another carbohydrase is presumed, as diatoms do not contain starch, which is the substrate for amylase. Growth (expressed as dry weight or any chemical constituent measured) showed a decrease in the same sequence of experimental condition as average ingestion and individual digestive enzyme activities. Strongest nutritional effects were observed in the lipid and protein fractions, where in starved control larvae losses of as much as 88 and 73% of the initial (early postmoult) values, respectively, occurred. Larvae feeding on S. costatum or T. rotula revealed similar losses, whereas those eating B. sinensis lost much less biomass. In the zoea I instar, B. sinensis allowed some (22%) gain in protein, however, this was accompanied by a significant (36%) loss in the lipid fraction. In the carnivorous control group, lipid and protein increased by up to 150 and 178%, respectively, with a decreasing percentage gain in subsequent larval instars. Gross growth efficiency (K1, C-based) in zoea-I larvae eating B. sinensis or T. rotula was only little lower than that in the carnivorous control (0.24-0.27 vs. 0.31); the same applied to zoea II eating B. sinensis (0.21 vs. 0.31). Consumption of S. costatum, in contrast, caused in all larval stages loss of carbon and consequently, negative K1 values. Our results indicate that all larval stages of H. araneus are in principle able to ingest and convert diatoms, with a clearly decreasing conversion efficiency in subsequent instars.

In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and similar to 39% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40%, 11%, and 10%, respectively, of relative protein abundances.

Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill-predator fishery dynamics to help advise on allocation of the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce the potential impact of fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e.g., a different spatial distribution of catches). The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies.

All countries continue to report significant threats to coral reefs including: local impacts such as over-fishing and land-based sources of pollution; and regional or global factors such as coral bleaching and disease. Over-fishing is considered to be the major cause of the high cover of macro-algae on these reefs because of the removal of herbivorous fishes such as parrotfish and doctorfish.

We examined a subset of 32 stands paired for location and type to further examine the effects of stand age. The paucity of mature stands severely constrained study design. Epiphytic lichen abundance and the percentage of alectorioid lichens increased with stand age, at least up to 120 yr, although not all trends reached statistical significance. Abundance and composition also varied with stand type and location. Relatively high-elevation (>400 m) mature and old-growth T. heterophylla/A, amabilis forests had a high abundance of lichen dominated by cyanolichens; low-elevation forests (<200 m) had a high abundance dominated by alectorioids; mid-elevation forests (300-400 m) had less lichen. Mature stands were either very small or were initiated by natural disturbances, and most contained structural remnants.

Several measures are useful for describing infectious diseases in host populations, but it is not straightforward to determine the degree to which a particular disease may affect a host population. The most basic epidemiological theory suggests that populations should be least subject to host-specific infectious disease when they are at low abundance ( paradoxically, the state at which they are in most need of conservation action). There are important exceptions, however, such as when a reservoir host exists or when Allee or stochastic effects occur. Several of the key threats to biodiversity-habitat alteration, introduced species, pollution, resource exploitation, and climate change-can facilitate and/or impair transmission of infectious disease. Common management tools such as population viability analysis rarely address infectious disease explicitly. We suggest that such an inclusion is both possible and warranted. Considerations of infectious disease may influence the way we determine whether a species is in need of protection and how we might design reserves and captive breeding programs. Examples from the literature suggest that (1) introduced pathogens can make abundant species rare and (2) diseases of domestic animals can dramatically affect rare species. For both scenarios, conditions that cause stress or reduce genetic variation may increase susceptibility to disease, whereas crowding and cross-species contact can increase transmission. Southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ) make an interesting case study for consideration of the intersection of epidemiology and conservation because disease may be an important factor limiting the growth of otter populations.

Assessing the impact of restoration strategies however relies on empirical data on waterbird community distribution patterns across natural and restored wetland components. We conducted habitat and waterbird surveys across six natural and restored wetland regions in the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve (YRDNR), eastern China, between 2007 and 2009. We recorded 93 waterbird species, including populations of 21 global conservation importance species. Community composition was stratified into distinctive clusters with compositional structure changing across these natural, modified and restored wetland components. NMDS ordination revealed that waterbird communities in restored wetlands were significantly different from those in natural and modified wetland components. Community distribution patterns were strongly influenced by environmental gradients (most noticeably salinity), water-level regulation, vegetation composition and differences in protected status. We found marked temporal patterns in waterbird community composition, which may be predictable for the different wetland components across the YRDNR landscape. Our study highlights the conservation benefits of restoring smaller wetland components in improving the ecological integrity of the wider wetland landscape mosaic for waterbird populations. A more coherent and intensive landscape management of water-level regulation and restoration of salinity gradients will be fundamental for wetland and waterbird conservation throughout the YRDNR.

We supplement this with qualitative data to illustrate the post-disaster challenges faced by residents, and the extent to which coastal communities have adapted to post-tsunami realities. Our analysis shows that the rehabilitation of rice cultivation and aquaculture in areas inundated by the tsunami has been limited by extensive degradation of land, diversion of labor by tsunami mortality and transition to alternative livelihoods, and re-purposing of rice fields for residential use during the reconstruction phase. This is especially prominent in areas where subsistence activities are not the primary source of livelihood. The Aceh case study shows that social, economic, and environmental factors can be stronger determinants of how coastal livelihoods rebound and change following destructive inundation events than livelihood rehabilitation aid.

Models were built to assess future trajectories. They assumed variable coral types (slow/fast growing), disturbance frequencies (5,10,20 years), mortality (equal or not), and connectivity (un/connected to un/disturbed community). Known disturbances were used to parameterize models. Present and future disturbances were estimated from remote-sensing chlorophyll and temperature data. Simulations and sensitivity analysis suggest community resilience at >20-year disturbance frequency, but degradation at higher frequency. Trajectories move from fast-grower to slow-grower dominance at intermediate disturbance frequency, then again to fast-grower dominance. A similar succession was observed in the field: Acropora to Porites to Stylophora/Pocillopora dominance on shallow reefs, and a transition from large poritids to small faviids on deep reefs. Synthesis and application: Even distant reefs are impacted by global changes. COTS impacts and bleaching were key driver of coral degradation, coral population decline could be reduced if these outbreaks and bleaching susceptibility were managed by maintaining water quality and by other interventions.

A total of 17 075 individuals was recorded, representing 35 butterfly and 5 day-flying moth species. Individual site species richness varied between one and 27 species. Two main groups of taxa were identified: (i) species that are reliant on remnant native vegetation for breeding and are entirely or predominantly restricted to remnant bushland (resident species or urban avoiders, 27 taxa); and (ii) species that now breed primarily on introduced plants and disperse readily through the urban matrix, but which also visit remnant bushland and sometimes breed there (non-resident species or urban adapters, 13 taxa). Estimated species detectability varied widely between species and seasonally, but for most taxa was consistent across the three years of the study. Peak detectability was strongly related to observed abundance, something that is well known (intuitively), but has rarely been demonstrated (quantitatively). Only one listed endangered species was recorded, the Graceful Sun-moth Synemon gratiosa which was observed in low numbers at six sites. Several species were encountered less frequently, although these have populations outside the region. Few of the surveyed remnants were considered to have an intact butterfly fauna; it is inferred that the majority had lost some or all of their original resident species. The reliance of many species on specific host plants, and the ability of some to adapt to introduced weeds, are important factors in their persistence within remnants. These bushland remnants are effectively habitat islands for butterflies and day-flying moths, and the few remaining species-rich bushlands are therefore of regional importance for conservation of this group.

Managerial efforts to prevent hypoxia and achieve recovery of ecosystems already affected by hypoxia are largely based on nutrient reduction plans. However, these managerial efforts need to be informed by predictions on the thresholds of hypoxia (i.e. the oxygen levels required to conserve biodiversity) as well as the timescales for the recovery of ecosystems already affected by hypoxia. The thresholds for hypoxia in coastal ecosystems are higher than previously thought and are not static, but regulated by local and global processes, being particularly sensitive to warming. The examination of recovery processes in a number of coastal areas managed for reducing nutrient inputs and, thus, hypoxia (Northern Adriatic; Black Sea; Baltic Sea; Delaware Bay; and Danish Coastal Areas) reveals that recovery timescales following the return to normal oxygen conditions are much longer than those of loss following the onset of hypoxia, and typically involve decadal timescales.

We have been monitoring black abalone populations along the coast of southern and central California since 1992, and detection of withering syndrome at our southernmost site prompted us to investigate how the impending decline of this dominant grazer might correlate with changes in black abalone recruitment and the rocky intertidal community in which it lives. Quantitative surveys before and after mass mortalities revealed that, after black abalone declined, there was a shift in the composition of the intertidal species assemblage from one dominated by bare rock and crustose coralline algae (good quality abalone habitat) to one with increased cover of sessile invertebrates and sea urchins. Declines in abalone abundance were also correlated with a lack of recruitment to areas affected by withering syndrome, despite the presence of healthy adult populations only tens of kilometers away. This suggests that abalone recruitment might be limited by dispersal, a lack of quality habitat for settlement and early survival, or the continued presence of the disease agent.

We review the role of sediment supply in channel structure, and how regional differences in sediment supply and land use affect stream restoration priorities. We show how stream restoration goals are best understood within a common fluvial geomorphology framework defined by sediment supply, storage, and transport. Land-use impacts in geologically young landscapes with high sediment yields (e.g., coastal British Columbia) typically result in loss of in-stream wood and accelerated sediment inputs from bank erosion, logging roads, hillslopes and gullies. In contrast, northern Sweden and Finland are landscapes with naturally low sediment yields caused by low relief, resistant bedrock, and abundant mainstem lakes that act as sediment traps. Land-use impacts involved extensive channel narrowing, removal of obstructions, and bank armouring with boulders to facilitate timber floating, thereby reducing sediment supply from bank erosion while increasing export through higher channel velocities. These contrasting land-use impacts have pushed stream channels in opposite directions (aggradation versus degradation) within a phase-space defined by sediment transport and supply. Restoration in coastal British Columbia has focused on reducing sediment supply (through bank and hillslope stabilization) and restoring wood inputs. In contrast, restoration in northern Fennoscandia (Sweden and Finland) has focused on channel widening and removal of bank-armouring boulders to increase sediment supply and retention.

Integrated into the global market, MAs have since expanded along the Chilean coast, involving thousands of small-scale artisanal fishers. This paper analyses how economic criteria relates to social and ecological performance of Chilean MAs, by applying TURFs, commons and co-management theory to two cases: MAs Penuelas and Chigualoco. To collect and analyse data Participatory Rural Appraisal tools, interviews and official statistics and reports were used. Our results show that MAs' economic benefits are connected to fluctuations on the global market. Adapting to changing world market prices then becomes paramount. TURFs' main goal is ecological conservation, but achieving this seems to depend on meeting fishers' livelihoods; failure to do so likely results in failure to meet conservation objectives. A serious weakness of the Chilean TURFs system is that it does not pay enough attention to fishers' livelihoods or to the global market context. Furthermore, there is a strong relationship between good economic benefits and social sustainability. But irrespective of economic performance, fisher organizations have been empowered and gained increased resource control with the TURFs system. At policy level, a differentiated and more flexible system could be more suitable for existing heterogeneous MAs and their particular economic, social and ecological challenges. For improved economic sustainability and resource conservation, a system with multiple-species managing MAs could be promoted as well. Finally, to enhance theory of commons, co-management and TURFs, we argue for greater acknowledgement of TURFs' social benefits in addition to economic assessments. More attention should also be paid to global market conditions of which MAs are dependent and in which they are embedded: macrostructures that are seldom considered in the analyses.",2011,,"{""Fernandez, Gloria L Gallardo"",""Friman, Eva""}",,journal,5,2,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""433"", ""end_page"": ""458"", ""primary_date"": ""2011-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""New marine commons along the Chilean coast - the management areas (MAs) of Penuelas and Chigualoco"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Fernandez, Gloria L Gallardo', 'Friman, Eva')""}"

Censuses were carried out at 13 stations belonging to 3 sectors: outside the reserve (no protection), non integral reserve (professional fishermen allowed with special permit) and integral reserve (no take area). The species richness by transect and mean density exhibited yearly fluctuations, but over the decade, were less variable in protected sectors that in the non protected sector. The level of variation of total fish assemblage density is lower than those of the main families (Labridae, Sparidae and Serranidae). The long-lived species (e.g., Serranus scriba) displayed lower density variations, i.e., higher inertia, that short-lived species (e.g., Symphodus ocellatus). The resilience of the assemblage (buffer effect) was not affected by spatial heterogeneity, but is related to the level of protection. The higher densities of predator in protected seagrass beds (e.g., Serranidae) and in bordering rocky areas could involve a higher predation pressure upon Posidonia oceanica fish assemblage.

Lauderdale, Florida, USA (26 degrees 07N, 80 degrees 05W). Modules were positioned at the apices of one of four differently sized equilateral triangles. Triangular configurations had side lengths of: 25 m, 15 m, 5 m, and 0.33 m; each treatment with two replicates. Two additional configurations: (1) a solitary module (Single) and (2) two modules side by side (Double), also with two replicates, were deployed in order to examine the interaction of reef size with fish assemblages. SCUBA divers censused fishes monthly, for 2 years, recording the species present, their abundance and sizes (TL). Fishes were assigned to one of five length categories: {\textless} 2 cm, {\textgreater} 2-5 cm, {\textgreater} 5-10 cm, {\textgreater} 10-20 cm, and {\textgreater} 20 cm. In general and excluding the smallest three-module spacing treatment (0.33 m treatment), which may have provided unique treatment-specific refuge, total fish abundance and richness were shown to increase when isolation distance increased. However, there were also species-specific and size class differences in response to isolation distance. The second part of this study indicated varying reef size, by doubling and tripling the number of reef modules, increased total fish abundance and species richness. Nevertheless, fish abundance and species richness did not change by an identical multiplier (e.g., doubling modules not equal double abundance). These results suggest that scientists and marine managers alike should consider reef size and isolation as habitat attributes capable of altering the structure and dynamics of reef fish assemblages.

However, given their stratified position in the river ecosystem and varying ecological requirements, aquatic and riparian communities can respond differently to such pressures. These biological responses could also vary depending on the nature of the disturbances, the spatial scale considered and the indicators used as response variable. Here, we aim to assess the influence of the main human pressures present in Mediterranean rivers (agricultural land use and hydromorphological alteration) on the biodiversity and ecological condition indicators of both riparian and aquatic communities at two spatial scales: reach and basin. For this purpose, a total of 56 sampling sites covering the study area (Segura basin, SE Spain) were surveyed. Water beetles and woody riparian vegetation richness were used respectively as biodiversity surrogates of aquatic and riparian communities, and the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party (IBMWP) and Riparian Quality Index (RQI) were used to assess the ecological status of both communities. As expected, we found a general decrease in both richness and ecological condition when human pressures increased, regardless of the spatial scale considered. Nonetheless, agricultural land use was the main pressure explaining riparian richness and quality, whereas aquatic communities' responses were highly related to hydromorphological alteration. Contrary to expected, in general, variables at basin scale had a greater effect than those variables operating at local scale. In addition, ecological condition indices responded more clearly to human pressures than biodiversity surrogates. Therefore, land use and hydrological planning at basin scale are essential complements to conservation and restoration efforts, traditionally carried out at reach scale, in order to maintain stream ecosystem integrity and biodiversity.

The species was distributed in the past in the entire Mediterranean Sea and the West Coast of Africa. Nowadays its population of ca. 500 individuals has been restricted in the E. Mediterranean, N. Africa, and the coasts of Mauritania, Morocco and Madeira. The main surviving population is in Greece and it is widely distributed along the Greek coasts. The main reason for the species decline is habitat destruction, while direct threats for its survival are considered to be deliberate killing of animals and accidental capture in fishing gear. Pollution, fisheries overexploitation, infectious diseases, or natural catastrophes are inadequately researched, but they may be also important for the population decrease. The rehabilitation of wounded, sick and orphaned animals constitutes a seminal tool when confronting species mortality. The first orphan monk seal pups in Greece were rescued and transported to Holland for treatment, by the team of Seal Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre (SRRC) in 1987. In 1990 the sameorganization donated to MOm (which was recently established as a national NGO) a mobile rehabilitation unit, which was established in Alonnissos and since then it has been the base of the Monk Seal Rehabilitation program. MOm established the monk seal rehabilitation program in Greece with the cooperation of SRRC, Erasmus University Rotterdam and the Veterinary Faculty of Thessaloniki. The parallel establishment of a Rescue and Information Network (RINT) in 1991 by MOm, and its development so as to cover all insular and coastal Greece, ensures the timely receipt of information on stranded animals and the effective response of the rescue team. The Monk Seal Rehabilitation Centre in Alonissos has been used exclusively for monk seal pups, whereas adults are usually treated on site, in order to avoid transportation stress. Overall 24 animals, out of which 17 pups and 7 adults, have been treated by the rescue team since 1987; 7 pups werereleased healthy to the wild in the protected area of the National Marine Park of Alonnissos N.Sporades, while 7 adult seals were released in the area of their stranding and treatment.

Development of this area of marine research has been limited by the lack of accurate benthic habitat maps, particularly for marine environments deeper than can be penetrated by optical remote sensing ({\textless} 10 m). However, the recent availability of detailed (1:25 000) and accurate habitat maps derived from hydroacoustic surveys of deeper marine waters has redressed this situation. The aim of this research was to establish the strength and significance of derived landscape composition and configuration indices on the demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution. A combination of depth and 6 landscape measures were found to explain 34.8{\%} of the variation in the fish assemblage. Depth contributed the highest percentage of the variance explained, accounting for 23.7{\%}. Distance to reef was the most important landscape index explaining 7.1{\%} of the variability, followed by total length of edge environment (the interface between different benthic substrates) explaining 1.5{\%}. Species responsible for driving the structure of the fish assemblage were also examined and found to respond not only to the proximity of reef but also to the configuration of the reef. For example, Parika scaber and Pseudolabrus psittaculus characterised more heterogeneous landscapes offering clusters of small interconnected patches of reef with a lot of edge environment, whilst juvenile Trachyurus novaezelandiae and Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus preferred more homogeneous landscapes offering little reef or edge environment.

The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) were calculated, which are being used in assessing the ecological status of benthic communities within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Clear impact gradients were detected according to both methods; they are related to farm production, prevailing currents, and characteristics of the area (i.e., water depth and distance to the cages). The site affected most was detected within 84 m from the cages; the area that no longer showed effects was over 907 m from the cages. The gradient is shown by decreasing AMBI values and percentage of opportunistic species and increasing richness, diversity, and the presence of sensitive species.

The basic changes of the Act refer to a different regulation of the concession granting procedure, which further significantly reflects on the efficiency of the concession awarding process. Certain provisions slow down the decision-making process and extend the competent jurisdiction to a number of ministries, and giving the Ministry of Finances a higher competence in the concession award system. The authors analyse the reasons for passing the Act in view of the fact that the compliance of national acts and regulations with their EU counterparts should not be done hastily. Legal regulations adopted in such a way question the efficiency of the concession system by prolonging the procedure period as the main factor of evaluation and of the efficient managing of the maritime domain and decrease the importance of decentralising the public administration. The public administration in Coatia is characterised by an authoritative management and conventional information flow. Because of the significance that the sea and coastal resources have for an efficient and sustainable economic development, such type of management, with permanent modifications of the law, often impede the progress. It is, therefore, necessary to phase in a team work and apply information technologies into the operations of the public administration.

It consists of an integrated suite of functions to preserve and realize the full value of the environmental data. Biological data presents its own unique set of stewardship challenges. For example, marine biological data are highly complex, sampling and analysis tends to be manual and therefore requires additional documentation, there is a lack of standards and community-agreed quality control procedures, and there is also a reluctance to share the data. These issues illustrate the difficulty in generating authoritative long-term records that can be used to understand todays environment in the context of the past. This is a task that can only be achieved in partnership with the community in establishing the products, documentation, standards, and vocabularies needed.

The uniqueness of these populations is emphasized by almost complete resistance to the dangerous parasite Gyrodactylus salaris. In Europe, freshwater salmon populations occur primarily in north-western Russia in the republic of Karelia. These systems include Lakes Ladoga and Onega, the two largest lakes in Europe, each of which harbours a number of freshwater salmon spawning rivers. We used microsatellite markers to study the genetic structure and temporal stability of 11 freshwater salmon populations in Russian Karelia. Populations clustered according their region of origin. Although temporal variation in allele frequencies was observed in the majority of temporal comparisons, various lines of evidence demonstrated that this influence was relatively minor compared to spatial variation that explained eight times more of the variability than temporal variation. Temporal stability tended to occur in populations from rivers with a higher linear lake coefficient. The high level of genetic structuring observed in both lake systems and the apparent low level of migration between populations suggests that treating each river as a separate management unit is recommended. In addition, as the number of populations is large, the best strategy for such fine scale management would be to ensure that the level of natural reproduction in each river is sufficient to sustain the population. A prioritization strategy for population conservation based on estimating the relative roles of different evolutionary forces shaping the gene pools highlighted a number of populations where further monitoring is warranted and also identified populations which could be prioritized for conservation as living gene banks in the event that conservation resources are limited.

The number of boats returning to three boat ramps in separate regions on the north eastern coast of New Zealand's North Island fluctuated over a ten year period between 2004-05 and 2013-14. The most pronounced change occurred in the Hauraki Gulf, where most recreational fishing occurs. Web camera monitoring detected a 34{\%} decline in the number of boats returning to one of the busiest ramps in the Hauraki Gulf over a three year period between 2011-12 and 2013-14, which was mirrored by a 58{\%} decline in snapper catch rates over the same period. The combined result was a 71{\%} decline in the weight of snapper landed annually at the monitored ramp over this three year period, which was far more rapid than anticipated given differences seen between harvest estimates provided by infrequent large scale surveys in the past. Trends in effort and harvest derived from data collected at a small number of ramps will only have utility, however, if they reflect trends in the wider fishery. The relative difference in snapper harvest estimates provided by aerial-access surveys of the entire Hauraki Gulf fishery in 2004-05 and 2011-12, closely matched the difference in the harvest landed at the high traffic ramp that was monitored in the Gulf during these years. This independent confirmation of relative trends inferred from combined web camera and creel survey monitoring at a small number of sites has further highlighted the need to continuously monitor recreational fisheries, which are potentially far more dynamic than previously thought. We discuss strategies that we have progressively developed to minimise the cost of monitoring these recreational fisheries and how they could be applied to continuously monitor recreational fisheries elsewhere.

However, estimating the amount of resource depredated can be especially challenging when depredation occurs on fish in the marine environment. This is the case for killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on the demersal Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fishery operating within the Crozet Islands EEZ (southern Indian Ocean). This study aimed at providing two indirect methods of assessment of depredated biomass over an 11-year period (2003 to 2013), accounting for spatial variations of depredation levels. In the first method, fishing data from 6 525 longline sets were used to calculate the difference between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of non-depredated and depredated lines. When killer whales and sperm whales occurred separately, 575 +/- 35 tonnes and 739 +/- 87 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish respectively were estimated to be depredated by the two species. When the two species co-occurred around vessels, 1679 +/- 74 tonnes were depredated. The second method used the differences in the proportion of grenadiers (Macrourus spp.) between non-depredated and depredated longline sets to estimate the number of depredated Patagonian toothfish. This approach, which can only be implemented when a sufficient level of by-catch species occurs, provides comparable results and thus strong support for the CPUE method. From these two methods, depredation rates were estimated to range from 27.3% to 29.1% of the total catch (landed and depredated), which is one of the highest among all similar situations where depredation is reported elsewhere in the world. In addition to providing a methodology that could be used in other areas with depredation issues, these findings emphasise the critical importance for fishery managers and researchers to account for depredation when assessing fish stocks, fishery economics and/or conservation of odontocetes.",2015,,"{""Duhamel, G"",""Gasco, N"",""Guinet, C"",""Tixier, P""}",,journal,22,,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""1"", ""end_page"": ""14"", ""primary_date"": ""2015-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Comparison of two methods to assess fish losses due to depredation by killer whales and sperm whales on demersal longlines"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Duhamel, G', 'Gasco, N', 'Guinet, C', 'Tixier, P')""}"

Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource utilization. Such life-history traits have important implications in interpreting tropho-dynamic linkages.

The trophic position of seals from Macquarie Island (54°30′S, 158°57′E) was estimated using stable carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen ({\&}{\#}948;15N) ratios along the length of the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake.

Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class of seals.

Spain",,"Since Moorish times, the lower slopes of the Sierra de Lujar in southern Spain have been intensively cultivated. Despite steep slopes and the highly erodible nature of the local micaschist/quartzite bedrock and derivative Quaternary sequences, accelerated erosion has largely been contained throughout this history by substantial, well-maintained rock terraces. However, since 1987, European Union (EU) agricultural policy has been to encourage the cultivation of certain crops by subsidising their expanded cultivation on a 'per hectare' basis. This has resulted in hasty clearance of native Mediterranean matorral on sites really unsuitable for the local staple crop (almonds), and erosion-prevention terraces are often absent or rudimentary. Gullying is now a very serious problem on some of these newly cleared sites. This paper identifies the lithological, topographic and agricultural policy controls on the consequent gully distribution, and then explores the pedological and hydrological controls on gully initiation on a single unterraced slope. Using these results alongside morphological data from gully surveys, a gully initiation and growth model is presented. This suggests that two types of gully are present in the area. 'Type 1' or upper-slope gullies are initiated by overland flows, which are relatively infrequent. By contrast, 'type 2' or slope-base gully initiation involves saturation and collapse in fossil landslip scars in Holocene colluvium. These two very different morphological systems may integrate through the terminal fan of the upslope gullies, in a manner described by Tiexeira de Oliveira 1990. The implications of this are that in the study area, sediment removal is associated with a very few highly productive sites.

New Zealand (NZ) sea lions Phocarctos hookeri are among the world's rarest pinnipeds with a restricted distribution and abundance to the most southerly limit of their known range, NZ's sub-Antarctic. Female NZ sea lions are the deepest and longest diving of the otariids, foraging further from their breeding rookeries than any other sea lion. In this study, the diving behaviours of 18 female NZ sea lions from Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, were recorded during early lactation over two austral summers, 2003 and 2004. While at sea, sea lions dived almost continuously, spending on average 52.7% of their time submerged (>6 m). The mean dive depth (+/- SE) for all dives was 129.5 +/- 5.3 m (range 94.6 +/- 1.1 to 178.9 +/- 1.6 m). The mean duration of dives was 4.0 +/- 0.1 min with an average of 40 +/- 2.9% of all dive times spent in the deepest 85% of the dive. Although there was high variation in diving behaviour among individuals, overall, animals were found to be diving beyond their estimated aerobic dive limits on 68% of all dives. Given that female NZ sea lions have a high percentage of dives that are beyond their theoretical aerobic limits, we ask whether this represents a miscalculation in aerobic limits, is it a species highly adapted to carry an anaerobic load or a species that is physically stretched to their limits?

Bluegill feeding and growth rates generally increased in simulations that removed less than half the vegetation, but exactly how much plant removal was optimal depended on the assumed characteristics of the edge habitat. Narrow channels produced the most edge habitat for a given plant removal effort and were most beneficial to bluegill. Clear-cutting large areas created little additional edge habitat, eliminated much invertebrate habitat, and decreased fish growth.

In the Mediterranean Sea, the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus is one of eight regular cetacean species. Poor knowledge of its ecology and status, together with suspected decline in numbers, make studies of historical and present occurrence especially relevant. Long-term time series of stranding events are the most reliable data to provide a scientific framework for testing hypotheses that seek to explain the mechanisms responsible for cetacean strandings. 2. We present a comprehensive overview of cases of sperm whale mortality and human response to such events encompassing five centuries (1555-2009) within a portion of the Mediterranean Sea that offers a wealth of historical information - the Adriatic Sea. 3. A total of 36 mortality events were validated, involving 68 animals. Two findings of skeletal materials are also reported. The geographic distribution of strandings within the basin clearly was uneven: 44% of records (n = 16) were clustered along a 280km portion of the western Adriatic coast. A relatively high number of mortality events occurred along gently sloping sandy beaches away from suitable sperm whale habitat. 4. Until the first half of the 20th century, live-stranded animals were routinely killed: all but one cases with known human response elicited killing attempts. Starting from the 1980s, killing was replaced by efforts to rescue the animals. 5. Mass strandings of sperm whales have occurred since historical times in the Adriatic Sea.

However, overall limited benefits in terms of revenues for local communities have so far been reported in some countries, whilst accidental introductions of several non-native fish species have occurred. To evaluate the benefits vs. costs associated with common carp Cyprinus carpio stocking practices, a three-year sampling study (2009-2011) was carried out across twelve adjacent artificial reservoirs of the Kocaeli Peninsula (north-west Anatolia, Turkey). Apart from common carp, 18 fish species in total were recorded, of which 12 native and six non-native, the latter comprising more than half of the total catch and dominated by gibel carp Carassius gibelio. Even though the abundance of common carp, natives and non-natives increased over the study period, common carp was always comparatively less abundant relative to most of the other species. Overall, the present findings indicate that stocking of common carp into the studied reservoirs has not fully met with the proposed objectives, likely a result of less-than-optimal age-0 fish release strategies and limited availability of spawning grounds.

However, serious challenges continue to plague the agriculture sector, including scarcity of land due to high population density, unbalanced use of fertilizers and pesticides, and great variation in water supply across seasons - from drought to stagnant flood conditions. Further expansion of irrigated area - including through the continued development and improvement of surface water systems - is being eyed by Bangladesh's Ministry of Agriculture to address many of the remaining challenges facing the country. However, such expansion is not without risks or consequences, and a careful analysis of who benefits from irrigation, and how, must guide development priorities. We examine plot-level data for rice production during Bangladesh's three rice seasons - aus, boro, and aman - across a nationally-representative household survey in Bangladesh. While rainfall is the most important determinant of rice yield during aus and chemical inputs are most important during aman, access to irrigation has the greatest influence on boro rice yield during the dry season, particularly for the coastal south. The government of Bangladesh is planning massive investments in the southern region for the improved provision of surface water irrigation. The expected decline in groundwater, coupled with our econometric findings, suggests that expanding boro production in the south may not be a good strategy to promote, for the region.

The HLS is a text product designed to inform local decision makers, the media, and the public on present and expected storm impacts in their county warning area (CWA) and adjacent waters. The intention is to provide local detail to the advisory package issued by the Tropical Prediction Center. The HLS is connected to the mission of the National Weather Service (NWS), assisting in the preparation and implementation of necessary precautions for the protection of life and property, as well as to minimize the economic losses as a result of tropical cyclone. In 1999, WFO Melbourne introduced the graphical Hurricane Local Statement (gHLS) as a complement to the HLS. The gHLS provided a web based graphical depiction, using bar charts, of tropical cyclone induced wind, surge, flash flood and marine threat levels. The concept of the gHLS was to display the HLS complex threat information in a manner more easily understood by the media, general public, and emergency management. WFO Melbourne has sought customer impact from a variety of sources, and the feedback received and compiled has been very positive, and has led to improvements in the product since the initial implementation. WFO Key West (EYW) has been producing and developing informational public service videos for local government and community access channels since early 2003. The videos were so well received that requests were made from the local television stations for live updates during Tropical Storm and Hurricane threats. However, the logistics involved in providing a live update during tropical events were prohibitive, so WFO Key West developed the video Hurricane Local Statement (vHLS) in response to customer demand, with the first operational usage occurring during Hurricane Charley (August 2004). The vHLS is available on the WFO EYW web site within an hour of the Tropical Prediction Center advisory package issuance, and can be downloaded or played with any of several standard PC based media players. The vHLS is developed using commercially available PC based audio and video software programs, and produces a graphical media file which displays images such as satellite pictures, tracking maps and storm-specific emergency information, with corresponding recorded audio track by a WFO EYW meteorologist. The Windows Media Video (WMV) format is used because it is highly compressible and can be compressed to match various bandwidths.

Samples were collected on five cruises to the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf between November 1999 and March 2001 as part of the Food for Benthos on the ANtarctic Continental-Shelf (FOODBANCS) Project. The 14C contents of the body tissues from a variety of deposit feeders (-126 +/- 13 per mil) were substantially enriched relative to the surface sediment (-234 +/- 13 per mil) and statistically similar to the organic matter collected in plankton tows (-135 +/- 10 per mil), indicating that recently produced marine plankton are the primary source of nutrition for these deposit feeders on the West Antarctic shelf. Selective ingestion was the primary feeding strategy used by echiuran worms and certain holothurians (i.e. Peniagone vignoni) for incorporating labile organic carbon into their tissues as demonstrated by the large differences (105 +/- 13 per mil) between surface sediment and gut content C-14 activities. In contrast, digestive and/or assimilatory, selection was the predominant strategy used by an irregular urchin (Amphipneustes lorioli) and several other holothurians (Protelpidia murrayi, Bathyplotes fuscivinculum and the head-clown conveyor belt feeder, Molpadia musculus), as demonstrated by large differences (42 +/- 7 per mil) between the 14C activities of their foregut or whole-gut organic contents and their body tissues. Despite large fluctuations in carbon export from the euphotic zone, benthic feeding strategies remained essentially constant over the 15-month sampling period. No seasonal variation was evident in either the 14C abundance of the deposit-feeder body tissues, or in the 14C abundance of their gut contents. The mean C-14 abundance in the body tissues of the two sub-surface deposit feeders (A. lorioli and M. musculus; mean = -136.2 +/- 8.5 per mil) was distinct (p = 0.0008) from the mean 14C abundance in the body tissues of the four surface deposit feeders (echiuran worm, P vignoni, P. murrayi, and B. fusciviculum; -122.6 +/- 12.3 per mil). The mean 14 C abundance of the gut contents from the sub-surface deposit feeders (-178.0 +/- 18.6 per mil) also was significantly depleted (p = 0.0009) relative to that of the surface deposit feeders (-149.5 +/- 26.6 per mil).

This is because the borders of marine ecosystems and the dynamics of some maritime activities, such as navigation, are not restricted to or bound by specific political and administrative borders. Cooperation across borders has been promoted by higher political levels for decades, and the implementation of cross-border consultation procedures is regulated by law. However, literature suggests that transboundary interaction is not an obvious step in the process of MSP and that today's practices have various weaknesses. This paper examines current practices and procedures of transboundary MSP interactions in the Baltic Sea Region to date. It brings together results from MSP process observations and interviews with marine planners in two recent research projects (Baltic SCOPE and BONUS BALTSPACE). Our results confirm the need for transboundary interaction and integration. The research also shows that there are differences in how MSP agencies interact with domestic and foreign stakeholders. Furthermore, formal transboundary consultations often seem to be limited to topics of the environment and health, and to the stakeholders responsible in these realms.

The temporal variability of solid and liquid flows, an important characteristic in Mediterranean regions, is the subject of this research, which focuses on the Wadi Bouhamdane in eastern Algeria. Since December 1987, the wadi flowsrecorded by the gauging station (1105 km(2)) since September 1969have been regulated by the Hammam Debagh Dam, located immediately upstream of the station (1070 km(2)). The study involved the treatment of a long time series of suspended sediment concentration and water flow data, together with daily water discharge data recorded at the dam site. A power function describing the relationship between the instantaneous suspended sediment loads and the instantaneous water flow was used to estimate daily suspended sediment discharge of two series (1969-1987 and 1995-2010), recorded, respectively, at the outlet of the basin (gauging station) and at the dam site. The results show a moderate mean annual specific suspended sediment flux (257 t km(-2) year(-1)), but high inter-annual variability characterizes the specific suspended sediment (TSS = 0.5 and 1396 t km(-2) year(-1) in 1996/97 and 2004/05, respectively), which increases significantly in the season of high streamflow. Thus, floods generate large quantities of sediment that represent a significant proportion of the annual total and monthly specific degradation throughout the basin. The comparative approach shows that the sediment flux estimated by concentration measurements at the wadi gauging station (0.22-0.29 hm(3) year(-1)) does not represent the entire volume of silting of the dam (0.98 hm(3) year(-1) on average), identified using bathymetry.

Efforts to reconcile any trade-offs among objectives need to be informed by knowledge on the consequences of alternate management actions. We develop, calibrate and apply a multispecies size spectrum model of the North Sea fish community to assess the response of populations and the community to fishing. The model predicts species' size distributions, abundance, productivity and interactions and therefore provides a single framework for evaluating trade-offs between population status, community and food web structure, biodiversity and fisheries yield. We show that the model can replicate realistic fish population and community structure and past responses to fishing. We assess whether meeting management targets for exploited North Sea populations (fishing species at F-MSY) will be sufficient to meet proposed targets for biodiversity and food web indicators under two management scenarios (status quo and F-MSY). The recovery in biodiversity indicators is 60{\%} greater when fishing populations at F-MSY than if status quo (2010) fishing rates are maintained.

To achieve the greatest conservation outcome at the lowest cost, managers could benefit from appropriate tools that evaluate the benefits (in terms of LBSP reduction) and costs of implementing alternative land management strategies. Here we use a spatially explicit predictive model (InVEST-SDR) that quantifies change in sediment reaching the coast for evaluating the costs and benefits of alternative threat-abatement scenarios. We specifically use the model to examine trade-offs among possible agricultural road repair management actions (water bars to divert runoff and gravel to protect the road surface) across the landscape in West Maui, Hawaii, USA. We investigated changes in sediment delivery to coasts and costs incurred from management decision-making that is (1) cooperative or independent among landowners, and focused on (2) minimizing costs, reducing sediment, or both. The results illuminate which management scenarios most effectively minimize sediment while also minimizing the cost of mitigation efforts. We find targeting specific ""hotspots"" within all individual parcels is more cost-effective than targeting all road segments. The best outcomes are achieved when landowners cooperate and target cost-effective road repairs, however, a cooperative strategy can be counter-productive in some instances when cost-effectiveness is ignored.

The St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC), located in the western arm of Lake Superior, provides a case study for how numerical sediment quality targets (SQTs) for the protection of sediment-dwelling organisms can be used to support the interpretation of sediment chemistry data. Two types of SQTs have been established for 33 COPCs in the St. Louis River AOC. The Level I SQTs define the concentrations of contaminants below which sediment toxicity is unlikely to occur, whereas the Level 11 SQTs represent the concentrations that, if exceeded, are likely to be associated with sediment toxicity. The numerical SQTs provide useful tools for making sediment management decisions, especially when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence approach that includes other sediment quality indicators, such as sediment contaminant chemistry and geochemical characteristics, sediment toxicity, and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure.

As part of the implementation of the Birds Directive in the UK, JNCC is currently undertaking work to contribute to the identification of the most suitable areas for consideration as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for birds in the marine environment. This work is being carried out on behalf of UK government and the nature conservation agencies (Natural England (NE), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), and, in Northern Ireland, the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside (CNCC). One strand of this work is the identification of seaward extensions to existing seabird breeding colony SPA boundaries, which are currently bound by the mean low water mark (mean low water springs in Scotland). This report presents recommendations in support of setting of site-specific seaward boundary extensions to three SPAs which have been designated for their internationally important concentrations of Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus, namely the Skomer and Skokholm SPA, Rum SPA, and Glannau Aberdaron and Ynys Enlli/Aberdaron Coast and Bardsey Island SPA. These SPAs include the UK's three largest Manx shearwater colonies, together hosting up to 90% of the world's population. Any seaward boundary extension to an existing seabird colony SPA should include marine areas on which the existing interest feature (in this case, breeding Manx shearwaters), are ecologically dependent. Breeding Manx shearwaters regularly form aggregations at sea (called rafts), up to 10km from the colony shore in the evening, prior to coming ashore to feed the chick after night-fall. Although the function of rafting is not known for certain, it is clearly an important behaviour, given the number of birds that engage in it, and the fact that rafts are regularly formed around the colony. It is not possible to use conventional visual survey techniques to assess the locations of rafting birds (primarily because rafts are formed in the evening through to nightfall). This report describes work using radio-telemetry to locate key areas used regularly in the evening by rafting Manx shearwaters around the three breeding colonies of Skomer (south-west Wales), Rum (western Scotland) and Bardsey (west Wales). Fieldwork was carried out between July and August, in 2003 (Skomer), 2004 (Rum) and 2005 (Bardsey), with radio-tags fitted to 30, 28 and 30 breeding adults at each colony respectively. Radio-tracking was carried out from early evening until birds returned to their colonies after nightfall, and locations of rafting birds were generated through analysis of radio-tracking data. Radio-tracking was found to be an appropriate and useful way of determining the spatial extent of Manx shearwater rafts, although there were some limitations to the data. The growth of chicks from tagged adults over the study period indicated that radio-tags did not significantly affect the adult's ability to adequately provision their chick on Bardsey or Skomer, but may have done to a small extent on Rum. Based on kernel analysis of the rafting locations of tagged birds, we recommend a seaward boundary extension of 4km for Skomer and Skokholm SPA, 6km for Rum SPA and 9km for the Bardsey Island part of the Glannau Aberdaron and Ynys Enlli/Aberdaron Coast and Bardsey Island SPA. For any other SPA for which Manx shearwater is a designated feature, we recommend a seaward boundary extension of at least 4km, or possibly further if future investigation suggests so.",2008,,"{""Dean, Ben J"",""Dunn, Timothy E"",""Gray, Catherine"",""McSorley, Claire A"",""Reid, James B"",""Webb, Andy"",""Wilson, Linda J""}",,journal,406,,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""1"", ""end_page"": ""43"", ""primary_date"": ""2008-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus evening rafting behaviour around colonies on Skomer, Rum and Bardsey: its spatial extent and implications for recommending seaward boundary extensions to existing colony Special Protection Areas in the UK"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Dean, Ben J', 'Dunn, Timothy E', 'Gray, Catherine', 'McSorley, Claire A', 'Reid, James B', 'Webb, Andy', 'Wilson, Linda J')""}"

The 50{\%} level corresponds to the recent natural variability of nutrient gradients in coastal and estuarine waters in the German Bight. Based on this threshold, a proposal is given for the additional boundary settings required for the WFD assessments. Examples, based on concentrations of total nitrogen and other correlated eutrophication components, are presented. However, for eutrophication effects such as oxygen deficiency, reduced transparency and increased transboundary loads, especially for offshore regions, 50{\%} exceedance of the natural background surpasses 'slight differences' as recommended by the boundary good/moderate for the WFD. For this reason, 15{\%} is proposed as the boundary setting for good/moderate and discussed for different parameters. Overlapping between recent means and their standard deviations and the four boundary settings for the WFD cannot be avoided, thereby causing weak assessments.

Knowledge of carbon storage in tropical forests is improving, but regional variations are still poorly understood, and this constrains forest management and conservation efforts associated with carbon valuation mechanisms (e.g., carbon markets). This deficiency is especially pronounced in tropical islands and low-lying coastal areas where climate change impacts are expected to be among the most severe. This study presents the first field estimate of island-wide carbon storage in ecosystems of Oceania, with special attention to the regional role of coastal mangroves, which occur on islands and coastal zones throughout the tropics. On two island groups of Micronesia (Yap and Palau), we sampled all above- and belowground C pools, including soil and vegetation, in 24 sites distributed evenly among the three major vegetation structural types: mangroves, upland forests, and open savannas (generally on degraded lands formerly forested). Total C stocks were estimated to be 3.9 and 15.2 Tg C on Yap and Palau, respectively. Mangroves contained by far the largest per-hectare C pools (830-1218 Mg C ha(-1)), with deep organic-rich soils alone storing more C (631-754 Mg C ha(-1)) than all pools combined in upland systems. Despite covering just 12-13{\%} of land area, mangroves accounted for 24-34{\%} of total island C stocks. Savannas (156-203 Mg C ha(-1)) contained significantly lower C stocks than upland forests (375-437 Mg C ha(-1)), suggesting that reforesting savannas where appropriate has high potential for carbon-based funding to aid restoration objectives. For mangroves, these results demonstrate the key role of these systems within the broader context of C storage in island and coastal landscapes. Sustainable management of mangrove forests and their large C stocks is of high importance at the regional scale, and climate change mitigation programs such as REDD+ could play a large role in avoiding deforestation of mangroves where this is a management objective.

Adaptation strategies are identified that alter positive feedback cycles contributing to a continued decline in population, local employment and retail spending. For instance, the diversification of employment opportunities and the attraction of new residents of different ages would be beneficial in preventing further population decline. Some impacts of climate change can be combated through recreational bag or size limits and monitoring of popular range-shifted species that are currently unmanaged, to reduce the potential for excessive removal.

The present study analyses the interactions in trophic ecology between the endangered Iberian toothcarp Aphanius iberus and the highly invasive eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki at a sympatric site where they have been verified to coexist for more than 10 yr. The existence of a habitat gradient in the system, mainly determined by salinity and accompanied by different proportions of the 2 fish species, made it possible to analyse dietary variation along that gradient. Overall results from gut content analysis showed a high degree of similarity in the spring diets of both species. However, the mosquitofish appeared to be a better competitor for food resources, as individuals of this exotic species presented a lower proportion of empty guts and their guts contained more food. Possibly associated with a certain degree of spatial segregation, a shift in the diet composition of the toothcarp and the mosquitofish was observed among sites with different salinities and relative abundances of both species. In general, in sectors of the channel with lower salinity levels and mosquitofish as the dominant species, toothcarp seemed to display more benthic feeding and, consequently, the diets of both species were less overlapped. Under such conditions, the toothcarp diminished feeding intensity and diet diversity. Thus, this native species could be subjected to a decrease in its population viability as a direct consequence of trophic relationship with the invasive fish.",2013,,"{""Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J"",""Ruiz-Navarro, Ana"",""Torralva, Mar""}",,journal,19,1,10.3354/ab00512,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""1"", ""end_page"": ""11"", ""primary_date"": ""2013-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Trophic overlap between cohabiting populations of invasive mosquitofish and an endangered toothcarp at changing salinity conditions"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J', 'Ruiz-Navarro, Ana', 'Torralva, Mar')""}"

A Water Quality Evaluation System (WQES) was developed for river systems by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Some form of biologically-based, habitat-specific reference standard seems absolutely essential for wise management and stewardship of marsh ecosystems. The goal of this study was to develop a statistical method to define and to characterize a water body typology for drained marshes of the Charente-Maritime wetlands on the French Atlantic coast, placing particular emphasis on environmental factors as hydraulic functioning, human activities and pedological substratum. The Charente-Maritime marshes represent a good field study because of his high diversity of types of marshes and of anthropogenic activities in a restrictive area thus erasing spatial climatic effect (latitude effect). The statistical method developed here had permitted to define and characterize 12 different water bodies, 7 in freshwater (F1 to F7) and 5 in salt water marshes for the Charente-Maritime area. This typology demonstrated an important link between the size catchment area, nitrate concentrations, and leaching of precipitation from cultured soils. Even though the Charente-Maritime marshes are strongly impacted by humans, they may still retain the ability to remove nitrate. The increasing gradient of water renewal in the freshwater marshes from F1 to F7 explained the decreasing gradient of eutrophication. A better management of the hydrodynamic of the marshes can avoid eutrophication risk on the coastal sea area. Reliance on the WFD parameter set necessarily placed limits on the kinds of interpretations that could be made and on the study's potential contribution to the basic science of marshes. Ecologically-based insights regarding both external flows (links between ecosystems, meta-ecosystem theory) and internal flows (structure of the planktonic food web) seem an essential prerequisite for further advances in the study of marsh ecosystems.

This study evaluates the potential costs of this approach in the industrial and municipal sectors, exploring economic, energy, and environmental costs (including CO2 emissions and possible coastal impacts). Although the energy intensity of desalination is a global concern, it is particularly urgent to rethink water supply options in Saudi Arabia because the entirety of its natural gas production is consumed domestically, primarily in petrochemical and desalination plants. This burgeoning demand is necessitating the development of more expensive high-sulfur gas resources that could make desalination even pricier. The evolving necessity to conserve non-renewable water and energy resources and mitigate GHG emissions in the region also requires policy makers to weigh in much more considerably the energy and environmental costs of desalination. This paper suggests that in Saudi Arabia, the implementation of increased water conservation and reuse across the oil and natural gas sectors could conserve up to 29% of total industrial water withdrawals at costs recovered over 0-30 years, depending on the specific improvement. This work also indicates that increasing wastewater treatment and reuse in six high-altitude inland cities could save a further $225 million (2009 dollars) and conserve 2% of Saudi Arabia's annual electricity consumption. By these estimates, some anticipated investments in desalination projects could be deferred by improving water efficiency in industry and prioritizing investment in sewage and water distribution networks that would ensure more effective water reclamation and reuse. Simultaneously, such initiatives would conserve non-renewable natural gas resources and could help prevent the lock-in of potentially unnecessary desalination infrastructure that is likely to become more energy and cost efficient in future.

The introduction of noise energy into the marine environment is of particular concern to those responsible for biodiversity protection and, specifically marine mammals and fish. In order to take steps to ban polluting activities or introduce mitigation measures it is important to establish a scientific case recognising adverse impacts and to fully understand the socio-economic implications and practicality of any proposed regulation. Issues to be resolved include clearly differentiating between impulsive and ambient noise impacts, understanding trends, and establishing significant impacts. In 2009 the OSPAR Commission, the competent authority for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic, published an overview of the impacts of anthropogenic underwater sound in the marine environment. Together with a review of the nature of sound and its measurement, and consideration of impacts, this overview examined the noise signature of different activities (construction, shipping, sonar, seismic). At about the same time the European Union established an expert group to guide Member States considerations with respect to noise energy as one of the eleven descriptors of Good Environmental Status under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) (EU 2008/56/EC). European Regional Seas Conventions have a specific role to play in co-ordination of implementation of the MSFD. For the North-East Atlantic the OSPAR Commission has included noise considerations in its Quality Status Report 2010 (OSPAR, 2010), the North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy 2010-2020 and committed to establishing an inventory of mitigation options. The EU expert Technical Sub-Group (TSG) continues to give consideration to indicators, thresholds, and monitoring guidelines. This paper sets out evolving mitigation including operational measures, habitat-based management, technology-based noise control and efforts to recognise cumulative noise impacts. Illustrative examples are also highlighted. The MSFD is the first legally binding instrument mentioning underwater noise. However, it excludes military activities and, being a Framework Directive, does not identify mitigation measures. It is concluded that sufficient evidence is in place to encourage widespread adoption of precautionary mitigation practices and recommended that such measures should, in the first instance, be linked to the conservation objectives of marine protected areas and hence those species most at risk from noise impacts.",2013,,"{""Johnson, David"",""Mouat, John""}",,book,,,,978-605-88990-9-4,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""117"", ""end_page"": ""124"", ""primary_date"": ""2013-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Developing a Regulatory Framework for Underwater Noise"", ""tertiary_title"": ""Global Congress on Icm: Lessons Learned to Address New Challenges, Vols. 1 and 2"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Johnson, David', 'Mouat, John')""}"

From the 1950s to the 2000s, the total sediment loads of the three rivers decreased by 81.2{\%}; this change has been primarily caused by human activities, such as dam construction and water soil conservation projects.

In response to the sediment supply decrease, the sediment regimes of the river channels in the lower reaches of the three rivers generally transitioned from deposition to erosion since the 1990s. The erosion of the channel has modulated the characteristics of the suspended sediment delivered to the estuary; for example, the erosion of the lower river channel increased the sediment flux and caused relatively coarser suspended sediments to be delivered to the estuary. As a consequence of the changes in the river basins, the evolutions of the three river deltas have transformed in the 2000s. The subaqueous deltas of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers changed from deposition to erosion. However, the Pearl River delta generally prograded seaward, and a portion of its subaqueous delta (e.g., the Modaomen River mouth) underwent erosion. In the coming decades, the sediment discharges into the seas from these three rivers are likely to decrease further because of intensifying human activities. Therefore, enhanced erosion in the three river deltas will continue when the river deltas remain unprotected.

() Nature Ecology and Evolution, 1420; TNC () Caribbean: A revolution to save coral reefs in the Caribbean and beyond). In Australia, there is increasing interest and investment in coastal restoration and habitat conservation, particularly with respect to growing national concerns around habitat loss, coastal inundation and erosion, loss of fisheries and climate change (Maggini et� al. () Protecting and restoring habitat to help Australia's threatened species adapt to climate change; GBRMPA () Reef summit sets new course of action for the Great Barrier Reef). This has led to new community of practices being formed for shellfish reef restoration (Shellfish Reef Restoration Network shellfishrestoration.org.au), seagrass restoration (Seagrass Restoration Network seagrassrestoration.net), and saltmarsh and mangrove (Saltmarsh and Mangrove Network, amsn.net.au) conservation. However, despite this interest, there has been no national coordination, network or society with coastal restoration as a primary focus. The inaugural Australian Coastal Restoration Symposium brought together 60 Australian restoration practitioners, researchers and managers at James Cook University, Townsville for three days from the 31st of August 2017. The symposium goals were to enhance collaboration and national coordination amongst coastal restoration projects and practitioners, as well as to connect researchers and practitioners working in the restoration space with one another. Three international keynote speakers shared their experiences and advice. Delegates were enthusiastic about continuing to meet at future symposiu, meetings and workshops, and noted the value of being able to connect, share project experiences and learnings, and collaborate.

This prevents harvesting to extinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining species' harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare and valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas. We analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the geographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance declines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining populations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance declines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range contractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors-which, ironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat loss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of range contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from profitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find that some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments experience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow profitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and some high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases. For terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but available evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be common among declining mammals and birds.

Using ArcGIS maps from a recent, high-resolution (1-4km) modelling study of 18 disturbance factors affecting coastal marine systems across the Mediterranean (Micheli etal. 2013, ), we tested for correlations with genetic diversity metrics (allelic diversity, genotypic/clonal diversity and heterozygosity) in a meta-analysis of 56 meadows. Contrary to initial predictions, weak but significantly positive correlations were found for commercial shipping, organic pollution (pesticides) and cumulative impact. This counterintuitive finding suggests greater resistance and resilience of individuals with higher genetic and genotypic diversity under disturbance (at least for a time) and/or increased sexual reproduction under an intermediate disturbance model. We interpret the absence of low and medium levels of genetic variation at impacted locations as probable local extinctions of individuals that already exceeded their resistance capacity. Alternatively, high diversity at high-impact sites is likely a temporal artefact, reflecting the mismatch with pre-environmental impact conditions, especially because flowering and sexual recruitment are seldom observed. While genetic diversity metrics are a valuable tool for restoration and mitigation, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of correlative patterns as found in this study, because the exceptional longevity of individuals creates a temporal mismatch that may falsely suggest good meadow health status, while gradual deterioration of allelic diversity might go unnoticed.",2015,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,24,,10.1111/mec.13174,0962-1083,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""2336"", ""end_page"": ""2348"", ""primary_date"": ""2015-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""A meta-analysis reveals a positive correlation between genetic diversity metrics and environmental status in the long-lived seagrass Posidonia oceanica"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Under the ITQ system, each vessel now receives transferrable annual allocations of quota for 29 groundfish species, including target and bycatch species. Here we develop an ecosystem and fleet dynamics model to identify which components of an ITQ system are likely to drive responses in effort, target species catch, bycatch, and overall profitability. In the absence of penalties for discarding over-quota fish, ITQs lead to large increases in fishing effort and bycatch. The penalties fishermen expect for exceeding quota have the largest effect on fleet behaviour, capping effort and total bycatch. Quota prices for target or bycatch species have lesser impacts on fishing dynamics, even up to bycatch quota prices of {\$}50 kg-1. Ports that overlap less with bycatch species can increase effort under individual quotas, while other ports decrease effort. Relative to a prior management system, ITQs with penalties for exceeding quotas lead to increased target species landings and lower bycatch, but with strong variation among species. The model illustrates how alternative fishery management policies affect profitability, sustainability and the ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2013.

With more than 8,000 killed and thousands homeless in Thailand, coupled with heavy impacts to fishing villages and large-scale loss of livelihoods, recovery challenges have been extensive. Patterns of uneven geographic development among a culturally and socially diverse population produced different recovery dynamics by location across the impact zone. Based on extensive fieldwork in the region by the lead author, we examine recovery dynamics in a representative coastal village. We begin by reviewing the historical geography of the area and how development patterns shaped local vulnerabilities prior to the tsunami. This provides context for analyzing impacts and response and recovery dynamics at the research site, with a focus on the diverse ways local leaders, displaced residents, government agencies, and NGOs promoted a variety of recovery strategies. We consider how relief organizations dealt with a culturally diverse population with substantial pre-disaster vulnerabilities, including the limitations of state-centered top-down approaches to recovery. Alternative approaches based on local leadership and collaborative networks across geographic scales proved more successful at coupling vulnerability reduction with local programs of recovery. We conclude with a discussion of the role of participatory approaches and local institution building in vulnerability reduction and capacity building in the region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The Soviet Union was the most important fishing nation, taking 80-90{\%} of the entire catch. More than 3 million tonnes of finfish were harvested prior to 1992/93, most of the catch coming from around South Georgia and Iles Kerguelen. After 15 years of exploitation, most fish stocks were heavily depleted. The krill catch from the Southern Ocean has been 4.9 million tonnes to date. More than 90{\%} of this catch has originated from the Atlantic sector. 50-90{\%} is taken from the foraging range of land-based predators during the critical period of their breeding cycle when they raise their young. This creates the potential for direct competition between krill fisheries and krill-dependent predators. Potential impacts of krill and finfishing on the ecosystems of the Southern Ocean range from endangering recruitment due to the by-catch of juvenile fish in the krill fishery to incidental mortality of birds during longline operations and the entanglement of seals in fragments of discarded or lost fishing gear. Most fish stocks had already been over-exploited before the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) came into force in 1982. Stringent conservation measures to halt the further decline of the stocks have been implemented only since 1989. There is evidence that some fish stocks have started to recover recently. Precautionary catch limits for krill of 1.5 million tonnes for the Atlantic sector (Statistical Area 48), and of 390,000 tonnes for Statistical Division 58.4.2 in the Indian sector, were set in 1991 and 1992, respectively. CCAMLR has implemented a number of conservation measures to safeguard other components of the marine ecosystems from fishing. CCAMLR adopted a system of inspection in 1989/90 and a scheme of international scientific observation in 1992. It is too early to judge the efficacy of these enforcement and data-gathering programmes. There is a growing recognition in CCAMLR of the need for preventative measures in circumstances of biological uncertainty. The development of multi-species management models appears to be remote at present. The way forward is likely to be a single-species model for the krill fishery, which needs to take implicit account of the demands of natural predators, particularly at small scales. If demersal fish stocks are able to recover to their maximum sustainable yield level, the fishery potential of the Southern Ocean is likely to be much larger than current catches. The fishery potential of krill and mesopelagic lanternfish is likely to exceed that of demersal fish stocks by an order of magnitude. By contrast with the 1970s and 1980s, when most fisheries were subsidized, economic considerations and market demands will be the primary determinants of the development of fishing in southern waters during the 1990s.",1994,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,30,,NA,0032-2474,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""3"", ""end_page"": ""22"", ""primary_date"": ""1994-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Fishing and conservation in southern waters"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Haddock and silver hake maintained similar temperatures in winter and summer by changing their depth distributions (temperature-keepers), with haddock generally at cooler temperatures than silver hake. Yellowtail flounder (a depth-keeper) maintained similar depths between seasons while tolerating a wide range of temperatures and salinities.

Fish farms contribute to eutrophication since they emit various forms of nutrients. Consequently, it is important to determine environmental impact caused by fish farms. Since the environmental response to a specific load can be very different among different coastal areas, it is important to develop methods to estimate the environmental response to a specific load. The aim of this work is to develop models that can be used in practice by the licensing authorities. Two new models are presented based on mass-balance equations for phosphorus, the train limiting nutrient in the studied coastal areas. They predict the increase in surface water total phosphorus concentration that occurs in coastal areas due to fish farm emissions. The calculated concentrations were compared against observed data from 21 coastal areas in the Angstromland archipelago (Baltic Sea). The models gave promising results with r(2)-values in the range 0.76-0.85. Modelled phosphorus concentrations were then used in two new regression models to predict the chlorophyll-a concentrations (r(2)-values from 0.72 to 0.84). The modelled increase in chlorophyll-a concentration was finally used in a regression model that predicts the decreased Secchi depth caused by fish farm emissions (r(2) = 0.57). Thus, the same data set (972 data points) was used both to construct and test the regression models. The models can be used to identify coastal areas of the Angstromland archipelago that are sensitive to fish faun emissions. Load diagrams were developed which can be used to get a rough estimate of the amount of fish that can be produced in a specific coastal area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Many ecosystems suffer systemwide outbreaks of damaging species propagating from primary outbreak sites. Connectivity patterns can identify parts of the ecosystem that help turn local outbreaks into a systemwide contagion through a series of transmission events. Here, we show that patterns of larval connectivity among reefs can help explain periodic crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) epidemics across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). 2. We simulated potential dispersal of COTS larvae to obtain a connectivity network of coral reefs across the entire GBR. Network analysis revealed areas of high local connectivity where any outbreaks could be amplified locally, as well as those areas with potential to cause large-scale epidemics with ecosystem-wide impacts. 3. We find that the regions where COTS epidemics are known to originate are predictable from their high local and systemwide connectivity. Extensive larval exchanges among reef clusters in these regions can start a chain reaction of COTS population build-up. The same regions also have high potential to reach and affect other parts of the GBR, thereby maximizing the likelihood that any outbreaks would eventually propagate throughout the ecosystem. 4. Hydrodynamic properties and geography of the GBR make it vulnerable to COTS epidemics. Using network analysis to identify regions with high-risk high-impact sources could help control these devastating events in future. 5. Synthesis and applications. The observed centre of origin for COTS epidemics (the Cooktown-Cairns region) can be predicted from its elevated short-and long-range levels of larval connectivity. Connectivity analysis of per-reef risks provides spatially explicit targets to guide surveillance and control measures that might help curtail COTS epidemics through prioritization of highly connected reefs. The analytical approach developed here for COTS connectivity can also be applied to identify well-connected patches and regions in other interconnected ecological systems.",2014,,{NA},{NA},Journal Article,51,,10.1111/1365-2664.12320,0021-8901,NA,NA,"{""url"": ""%25%7D3CGo to"", ""pages"": ""1188"", ""end_page"": ""1196"", ""primary_date"": ""2014-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Connectivity networks reveal the risks of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef"", ""place_published"": ""NA"", ""primary_authors"": ""('NA',)""}"

Changes were spatially variable according to the MPA's use area considered. During this period there was a sea urchin density reduction (in some cases from 3.34 to 0.45 indv.m(-2)), and an increase of erect seaweed (up to 30{\%} of cover) in the sites of the no-take area. In the partially restricted fishing area, the effect was less clear and only some sites, near to the no-take area, showed the sea urchin reduction and seaweed growth, in contrast to the increase of sea urchin densities outside the MPA. In addition to increased coverage, there was also a replacement of the ephemeral species by the perennial seaweed Lobophora variegata. These changes were related to increases in the abundance of fish predators of the sea urchins. In the no-take area, where there is total fishing restriction, predators were so abundant to induce shifts in the benthic community, while in the partially protected area such as outside the MPA, fishing prevented the top-down process and the changes in the communities.

Therefore I define ecotourism as all visits that focus on nature appreciation and the associated infrastructure (park facilities, tours, accommodation, airlines that bring tourists to the area etc.) that supports these visits. This definition, which is used throughout this paper, helps eliminate the false distinction being made between tourism and ecotourism. Tourism, at the international and national political level, has an influential role as a force for biodiversity conservation by being a rationale for placing extra land in conservation reserves, or otherwise by sustainably managing natural areas for their natural values. Using World Heritage Areas (WHA) as an example-perhaps even as an indicator of tourism and its impacts on natural areas- the little information available suggests that tourism is not often a threat, but that warfare, clearing for agriculture, and poaching are. Regions with an intact tourism industry are also those more likely to have an intact ecosystem. National parks do act as a catalyst for tourism growth. The question is whether tourism can deliver the financial means to undertake management to neutralize the impacts of tourism on biodiversity, or, perhaps more importantly, to fund more extensive works for biodiversity conservation?

The experiments involved the assessment of prey size selectivity, total number of prey consumed and size-specific indicators of foraging efficiency such as capture success and handling time. Pumpkinseeds were size selective only at medium and high prey densities, preferring large Gammarus when selectivity occurred. The proportion of mobile and immobile prey consumed increased with prey size in unstructured habitat, whereas no selectivity occurred with mobile prey in structured habitat. Both habitat and prey density significantly affected prey consumption, with more prey eaten at higher densities and in unstructured habitat. Prey mobility did not affect the number of prey consumed when mobile or immobile prey were offered in separate trials, but the consumption rate of immobile prey increased in structured habitat when they were offered with mobile prey in the same trial. We conclude that prey density and habitat structure affect pumpkinseed size selectivity and consumption rates in a similar manner, whereas the effect of prey mobility on these factors is more dependent on the combination of density and habitat and on whether mobile and immobile prey are present at the same time.",2006,,"{""Fox, M G"",""Lasenby, D C"",""Zhao, X X""}",,journal,165,2,10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0269,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""269"", ""end_page"": ""288"", ""primary_date"": ""2006-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Effect of prey density, prey mobility and habitat structure on size selection and consumption of amphipods by a benthic feeding fish"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Fox, M G', 'Lasenby, D C', 'Zhao, X X')""}"

These three factors were analyzed for a small coastal MPA, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), for which a very limited amount of local ecological information was available when implemented in 1998. Marxan was used to provide a number of near-optimal solutions considering different levels of protection for the various conservation features and different costs. These solutions were compared with the existing no-take area of the LSMP. Information on 11 habitat types and distribution models for 3 of the most important species for the local artisanal fisheries was considered. The human activities with the highest economic and ecological impact in the study area (commercial and recreational fishing and scuba diving) were used as costs. The results show that the existing no-take area is actually located in the best area. However, the no-take area offers limited protection to vagile fish and covers a very small proportion of some of the available habitats. An increase in the conservation targets led to an increase in the number of no-take areas.

The numerous difficulties include limited space availability, restricted recycling and resale opportunities and impacts on the local environment that become magnified particularly when the island is small-sized, densely populated and tourist dependent. The well-documented impact on the local environment includes resource loss, damage to the marine and local environment and continuous nuisances created by littering, trucks and treatment facilities. However, waste management can leave its mark beyond the local borders. The generation and treatment of waste is in fact gaining attention in its connection with greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Although in the past GHG emissions were mainly associated with energy generation, today it is frequently acknowledged that improved waste management can also mitigate these emissions. This research paper analysis the flows involved in the management of municipal waste (MW) from an island perspective. Focusing on the island of Malta, which consists of 316 km(2) and sustains a population density of 1327 people/km(2), a Material Flow Analysis together with a carbon footprint is presented for 2012. The same analysis is then made for three prospective scenarios proposed in the Waste Management Plan for the Maltese Islands 2014-2020 using projected 2018 data. With the use of STAN 2.5 (SubSTance Flow ANalysis), a tabled down analysis of the collection, treatment and disposal/export flows involved in the management of Municipal Waste in Malta is presented. The flows are then translated into a carbon footprint analysis using CO2ZW (R)((a carbon footprint tool for waste management).)The objective is to emphasize the relationship between GHG remove GHG and replace with Greenhouse Gas emissions and existing waste management flows and how this relationship changes when different collection, treatment and disposal options are selected. The research's ultimate aim is therefore to underline the importance of placing climate concerns in waste management policies. The results note that, in terms of carbon emissions, Malta stands to benefit from the introduction of a second Mechanical Biological Treatment plant since carbon emissions will experience an extensive reduction from the 2012 estimates. However, further reduction of carbon emissions should be accompanied by the increase of dry material recycling, separate organic collection and an analysis of the current collection system particularly route optimisation.

Historically, lesser snow geese wintered in the coastal marshes, but expanded their range into the adjacent prairies in the mid-1900s. Winter range expansion was negatively affected by urban and industrial encroachment in the coastal marshes and positively influenced by agricultural development in the prairies, which increased dramatically during World War II.

Criteria for habitat suitability were those identified in freshwater reservoirs (temperature below 25-degrees-C and dissolved oxygen above 2-3 mg/L), which we confirmed for the York-Pamunkey estuary in the lower bay. Habitat suitability in the upper central basin in July declined significantly from 1962 to 1987, as did juvenile abundance indexes (mean catches per standard seine haul). Thickness of suitable temperature-oxygen habitat correlated significantly with Maryland juvenile indexes the following year. Relative reproductive performance of upper (Maryland) and lower (Virginia) bay stocks changed between 1967-1973 and 1980-1988 in parallel with reduction in upper bay summer habitat. The annual temperature-oxygen cycle in the bay revealed two key areas for striped bass subadults and adults: (1) a zone of cool water in north-central Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland, where fish of these ages congregate in summer, and (2) a shallow sill across the lower bay near the mouth of the Rappahannock River, Virginia, where warm surface waters ( {\textgreater} 25-degrees-C) in summer impinge on the bottom and may block egress from the bay. The importance of year-round bay residents for reproduction in the upper bay may have been underestimated previously, at least for the recent low population levels.

To ascertain if key elements for integration exist, fundamental questions should be addressed: Are there (compatible) national policies/plans for the coast and ocean? Are ICM strategies in line with MSP policies? Are the agencies responsible for ICM and MSP coordinated? Are there common goals, indicators and integrated measures between both types of policies/plans? Portugal is one of the world's largest maritime nations, and is actively engaged in preparing policies and planning/management legislation for the ocean. An analysis of the current Portuguese policy/legislative framework, in terms of the above mentioned questions, suggested that: coordination among coastal and maritime policies and strategies is unclear, as is. the articulation between institutions and between spatial plans for coastal and maritime zones; objectives of relevant policies are mismatched; there are yet no indicators to evaluate coastal and ocean policies/plans, and the articulation between measures to integrate ICM and MSP is unclear.

Due to its relatively low income levels, large number of recent immigrants, and current environmental stresses, it is also a community suffering from environmental injustice. As complicated as adaptation to climate change may be, it is even more complicated when looking at the particularly complex situation of environmental justice. In this community it is found that the community did not have an adaptation perspective or knowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge. The residents also seem to have little power over the management of their community with the result that adaptation decisions may be made by processes, institutions and individuals from outside the community. All adaptation options have some disincentives for them; with high costs being common to all. Their cultural knowledge also limits their viewpoints on alternatives. Participants believe they need more information on climate change, how it will impact them, and what resources are available to assist them. Incentives for adaptation include a very broad ranging, accepting view of climate change impacts, commitment to their communities, eagerness to continue learning about climate change, and recognition that there is the need for an integrated regional flood management planning process that is stakeholder driven. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

We performed demographic analyses on Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, a zooplanktivorous seabird inhabiting the variable California Current System, to understand how temporal environmental variability influences population dynamics. 2. We used capture-recapture data from 1986 to 2002 to rank models of interannual variation in survival, breeding propensity, breeding success, and recruitment. 3. All demographic parameters exhibited temporal variability. Interannual variation in survival was best modelled as a nonlinear function of the winter Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Breeding propensity was best modelled as a threshold function of local sea surface temperature. Breeding success and recruitment were best modelled with year-dependent annual variation. 4. Changes in the SOI force El Nino/La Nina events, which in turn alter prey availability to seabirds in this system. Demographic responses varied during El Ninos/La Ninas. Survival diminished substantially during the 1997-98 El Nino event, while breeding propensity was affected during both the 1992 and 1998 El Ninos. Breeding success was reduced during the 1992, 1993, and 1998 El Ninos, but was unusually high in 2002. Recruitment was higher at the beginning and end of this time-series. 5.

In June 2014, in response to community concern, Wollongong City Council, a local government authority in southeast Australia, took the unconventional step of removing vegetation and re-profiling the foredune in a section of Woonona Beach to improve beach width and sightlines. A series of cross-sections in the re-profiled and adjacent unmodified areas have been surveyed monthly since July 2013, to help determine the impact of the intervention on beach and foredune topography. These show that immediately after re-profiling, considerable additional lower beach width was gained, and there was little accretion on the foredune that had been re-profiled. However, after 8 months, the importance of the re-profiling in maintaining lower beach width is less clear, and an incipient foredune is emerging at the new vegetation line, with about half the volume of sand removed during re-profiling re-deposited in this area. After 21 months, lower beach width gain from re-profiling had disappeared, and the volume of sand deposited on the new incipient foredune is more than the volume removed by the re-profiling. The results are discussed in terms of whether the short-term outcomes achieved by the re-profiling are being compromised, and what on-going management will be required to maintain these over the longer term.

Two types of sediments, differing mainly in content of reactive Fe, were used. The aim of this experiment was two-fold, (1) to evaluate the importance of Fe-driven sulfide buffering for sulfide accumulation in surface enriched sediments, and (2) to estimate the diagenetic capacity for degradation of labile OM near the sediment surface. The simulated OM loading rate of 375 mmol C m-2 day-1 led to a 5-6 times increase in CO2-production and a 4-5 times increase in O2-uptake. Sulfate reduction estimated by radiotracer experiments and CO2-release was 105-131 mmol m-2 day-1, but accumulation of porewater sulfide was low in both sediment types. Instead 99% of sulfide was oxidized with O2 at the sediment water interface in the low Fe treatment, whereas 46% of produced sulfide precipitated as Fe-S compound in the high Fe treatment resulting in significantly lower O2-uptake. Furthermore, the accumulation of up to 30% of added OM by the end of the experiment indicated a saturation of the heterotrophic microbial communities in the upper enriched surface layer. These results suggest a maximum diagenetic capacity for OM degradation in the range of ~25 $μ$mol C cm-3 day-1 or 260 mmol m-2 day-1 for the present sediment types. ©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",2009,,"{""Holmer, M"",""Kristensen, E"",""Valdemarsen, T""}",,journal,95,2,10.1007/s10533-009-9340-x,,,,"{""url"": ""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71649094061&doi=10.1007%2Fs10533-009-9340-x&partnerID=40&md5=b59d56b50e805e2b08ad081d258d9466"", ""pages"": ""335"", ""end_page"": ""353"", ""primary_date"": ""2009-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""Metabolic threshold and sulfide-buffering in diffusion controlled marine sediments impacted by continuous organic enrichment"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Holmer, M', 'Kristensen, E', 'Valdemarsen, T')""}"

The overarching recommendation of PDT-2 is that inputs for weather forecast models can best be obtained through the use of composite observing systems together with adaptive (or targeted) observing strategies employing both in situ and remote sensing. Optimal observing systems and strategies are best determined through a three-part process: observing system simulation experiments, pilot field measurement programs, and model-assisted data sensitivity experiments. Furthermore, the mesoscale research community needs easy and timely access to the new operational and research datasets in a form that can readily be reformatted into existing software packages for analysis and display. The value of these data is diminished to the extent that they remain inaccessible. The composite observing system of the future must combine synoptic observations, routine mobile observations, and targeted observations, as the current or forecast situation dictates. High costs demand fuller exploitation of commercial aircraft, meteorological and navigation [Global Positioning System (GPS)] satellites, and Doppler radar. Single observing systems must be assessed in the context of a composite system that provides complementary information. Maintenance of the current North American rawinsonde network is critical for progress in both research-oriented and operational weather forecasting. Adaptive sampling strategies are designed to improve large-scale and regional weather prediction but they will also improve diagnosis and prediction of flash flooding, air pollution, forest fire management, and other environmental emergencies. Adaptive measurements can be made by piloted or unpiloted aircraft. Rawinsondes can be launched and satellites can be programmed to make adaptive observations at special times or in specific regions. PDT-2 specifically recommends the following forms of data gathering: a pilot field and modeling study should be designed and executed to assess the benefit of adaptive observations over the eastern Pacific for mesoscale forecasts over the contiguous United States; studies should be done over the western Atlantic and Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico regions, particularly during hurricane season; and enhanced observations should be implemented for the mountainous western states and for the Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys. Data sensitivity tests and observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are important tools for gauging the benefit of existing or proposed observing systems. OSSEs involve only model predictions and are essentially self-contained. Data sensitivity tests require the full consideration of modeling infrastructure, namely, observation ingest quality control, objective analysis, and numerical prediction. Sensitivity tests involving both wind and moisture profiles are particularly needed to determine their impact on improved precipitation forecasts. New variational analysis techniques are capable of assimilating so-called proxy observations. These techniques should be fully exploited. Diabatic initialization should be addressed through the assimilation of satellite cloud data and very high resolution WSR-88D radar measurements into very high resolution models with sophisticated cloud microphysics. Success in this area should improve quantitative precipitation forecasts in the first few (model) hours. There is a pressing need to better understand the interaction of moist convection with large-scale flow. One key is better characterization of the impact of precipitation formation and evaporation on the fluxes of mass, momentum, and heat in moist convection. Humidity measurement in precipitating downdrafts is a crucial measurement, which currently cannot be made reliably. The capabilities of polarization-diversity radar should be explored in a quasi-operational context to determine whethe WSR-88D radars should be upgraded. Progress in quantitative precipitation forecasting is impeded by poorly resolved and inaccurate water vapor measurements. Further improvements in numerical weather prediction demand improved monitoring of Earth surface characteristics so that spatial and temporal variations in air-surface fluxes are realistically simulated. Over land, priority should be given to the coupling of mesoscale meteorological models with hydrological models and to routine assimilation of surface (soil, moisture, and plant) characteristics. Improved air-sea fluxes are essential to proper modeling of marine cyclogenesis.

The survival rate after capture and tagging was 58{\%}. Mortality during capture was positively correlated with depth of capture and negatively correlated with hake size. Fifteen months after tagging, seven individuals (1.3{\%}) had been recaptured with times at liberty ranging from 29 to 466 days. We provide the first direct measurements of growth rates of Southern stock European hake in the wild and compare them with rates obtained from tagging experiments in other regions and with rates derived from conventional otolith age reading. The mean somatic growth rate of all recaptured hake was 0.032 +/- 0.016 cm day(-1) (sexes combined), while the mean growth rate of the two hake with over 340 days at liberty was 0.052 +/- 0.003 cm day(-1) (sexes unknown). These results indicate that conventional otolith age reading methods overestimate age and underestimate growth.

The CROZEX study (2004/2005) tested the hypothesis that annual blooms occurring immediately north of the Crozet islands in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) develop because of natural iron fertilisation, while to their south in HNLC waters, there is insufficient iron (Fe) to promote blooms. Size-fractionated nitrogen uptake (rho N) experiments using (15)N-NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+) and urea addressed three major goals. Firstly, measurements of NO(3)(-) uptake (rho NO(3)(-) aimed to establish whether rho NO(3)(-) responds to natural Fe fertilisation. Secondly, we compared regional rho NO(3)(-) rates, hypothesising that in Fe-fertilised regions, rho NO(3)(-) should exceed that in HNLC regions. Thirdly, by using satellite imagery, we extrapolated rho NO(3)(-) measurements made during a declining bloom to reconstruct seasonal rho NO(3)(-) by the spring bloom. Finally, we estimated the 'new' Fe demand required to support rho NO(3)(-), comparing this with estimated Fe fluxes. Diatoms and colonial Phaeocystis dominated phytoplankton communities north of the islands, while to the south, Phaeocystis was absent. Total rho N was elevated north of the islands (similar to 400 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) relative to south of the islands (similar to 250 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)). Nitrate uptake showed a clear response to Fe fertilisation, exhibiting a strong north (similar to 198 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) to south (similar to 74 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) gradient, while neither rho NH(4)(+) nor purea showed such significant latitudinal gradients. The N-S integrated f-ratio gradient was 0.47-0.28 while specific N uptake (V(NO3) d(-1)) rates were significantly higher in the Fe-fertilised region relative to those in the southern HNLC region. The potential for NH4+ inhibition of pN03- did not appear to be significant. High PON:chl-a ratios combined with relatively low (14)C:(15)N uptake ratios suggested that most phytoplankton were relatively chlorotic and carbon stressed, with the exception of those growing actively within a cyclonic eddy where neither Fe nor light appeared to be limiting. Size-fractionated pN03- and f-ratios exhibited a complex response to NH(4)(+) and Fe availability, with f-ratios in the >20-mu m fraction being low (similar to 0.3) in the HNLC region, but significantly higher (similar to 0.7) in a localised diatom-dominated bloom in the northern Fe-fertilised region. In contrast, f-ratios in the <2-mu m size class were similar everywhere (similar to 0.44), indicative of Fe-limitation for large-celled diatoms in the southern HNLC region. As a result of Fe-regulated rho NO(3)(-), new production showed a N-S gradient of similar to 24 to similar to 15 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), very similar to carbon export determined from NO(3)(-) 'draw-down' and from (234)Th measurements. The estimated DFe demand required to support seasonal pN03- in the northern region, based on conservative cellular Fe:N quotas, required surface (to 100 m) pre spring-bloom DFe concentrations of similar to 0.75 nmol l(-1). Our results support the hypothesis that phytoplankton blooms north of the islands are stimulated by natural Fe fertilisation, with a direct impact on rho NO(3)(-), particularly for larger cells, resulting in higher new production rates relative to those from the Fe-limited HNLC region south of the Crozet islands.

SRB were enriched and isolated from samples of hydrothermal water, invertebrates, chimneys, and sediment collected at deep-sea (1700 to 2600 m) hydrothermal vent sites in the Lau Basin, in the North Fiji Basin, and at 13 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise. From the hydrothermal fields in the Lau Basin and the North Fiji Basin, SRB were cultured at 30 degrees C from 19 out of 21 samples, including five samples of high-temperature hydrothermal water (>100 degrees C). Acetate, benzoate, formate, isobutyrate, and lactate were supplied as single electron donors and could all be degraded by SRB. From the site at 13 degrees N, SRB were enriched at 20 or 40 degrees C from seven out of 20 samples. Two Desulfovibrio. strains, H 2.5 and H 5.3, originated from the tubes of the polychaete Alvinella sp. and these strains had optimum temperatures at 37 to 40 degrees C with doubling times of 3.6 and 6.6 hours, respectively. In cultures of strain H 2.5, which had reached the stationary growth phase, almost the entire populations (>99%) changed into round pleomorphs (coccoid bodies). However, cultures of vibrio-shaped bacteria were recovered upon transfer of an inoculum to fresh medium. No distinct changes in the composition of the cell membrane phospholipid fatty acids were associated with the morphological transformation. In the deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment, mesophilic SRB occurred frequently and may thrive in anoxic habitats in association with warm vent animal communities.",1995,,"{""Benbouzidrollet, N"",""Elsgaard, L"",""Guezennec, J"",""Prieur, D""}",,journal,18,1,,,,,"{""url"": ""to"", ""pages"": ""95"", ""end_page"": ""104"", ""primary_date"": ""1995-01-01 00:00:00"", ""primary_title"": ""MESOPHILIC SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA FROM 3 DEEP-SEA HYDROTHERMAL VENT SITES"", ""primary_authors"": ""('Benbouzidrollet, N', 'Elsgaard, L', 'Guezennec, J', 'Prieur, D')""}"
